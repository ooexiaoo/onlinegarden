### Fleeting Notes
1. You can put elements inside other elements too, This is called as nesting elements.
2. We can wrap "Varun" in a strong element
```
<p>My name is <strong>Varun</strong></p>
```
3. You however need to make sure that the elements are properly nested. Meaning that the sequence of tags should be placed properly.
