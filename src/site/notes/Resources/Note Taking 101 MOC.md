There are many types of notes that I'll be using in this app. The reason to use these kinds of notes is to sort out content and make proper tags so it becomes easy to find them later on.

Some much needed abbreviations for understanding the process -

* [[Resources/MOC\|MOC]]
* [[Resources/PKM\|PKM]]

Here are the kind of notes I'll be using -

* [[Resources/Fleeting Notes\|Fleeting Notes]]

* [[Resources/Literature Notes\|Literature Notes]]

* [[Resources/Permanant Notes\|Permanant Notes]]
