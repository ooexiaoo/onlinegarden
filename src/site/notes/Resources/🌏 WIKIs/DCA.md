## Dollar Cost Averaging
[[Dollar Cost Averaging\|DCA]] is one of the most important concept that can minimize risk over time.

Setting aside a particular date to invest every month will help you invest consistently and also minimize risk as you're not making a lumsum payment, as preditcing when to enter the market is nothing more than a coin toss. It's just luck! You either enter the right time or you don't.

[[Resources/🌏 WIKIs/Habits\|Habits]] Although there are some golden days where you can clearly see it's the right time to invest but, can you ever be 100% sure about that is still a question you need to ask yourself. So creating a system that helps you minimize risk is the right way to approach the problem. Dollar cost averaging lets you do just that.

## ▶ Example

An investment of $200,000 in equities using DCA can be made over eight weeks by investing $25,000 every week in subsequent order. The table below illustrates the trades for lump-sum investment and DCA strategy:

The total amount spent is $200,000, and the total number of shares purchased with a lump-sum investment is 2,353. However, under the DCA approach, 2,437 shares are purchased, representing a difference of 84 shares worth $6,888 at the average share price of $82. Therefore, DCA can increase the number of shares purchased when the market is declining and can lead to fewer shares purchased if the share price is rising.

The dollar-cost averaging example above is better explained diagrammatically as below:
