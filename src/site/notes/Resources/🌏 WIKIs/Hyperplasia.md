**Hyperplasia** (from [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") ὑπέρ _huper_ 'over' + πλάσις _plasis_ 'formation'), or **hypergenesis**, is an enlargement of an organ or tissue caused by an increase in the amount of [organic tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology) "Tissue (biology)") that results from [cell proliferation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_proliferation "Cell proliferation").[[4\|4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia#cite_note-4) It may lead to the [gross enlargement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_anatomy "Gross anatomy") of an organ, and the term is sometimes confused with benign [neoplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasia "Neoplasia") or [benign tumor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor "Benign tumor").[[5\|5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia#cite_note-Sembulingam-5)

Hyperplasia is a common preneoplastic response to stimulus.[[6\|6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia#cite_note-6) Microscopically, cells resemble normal cells but are increased in numbers. Sometimes cells may also be increased in size ([hypertrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophy "Hypertrophy")).[[7\|7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia#cite_note-7) Hyperplasia is different from hypertrophy in that the [adaptive cell change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_adaptation "Cellular adaptation") in hypertrophy is an increase in the [_size_ of cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_size "Cell size"), whereas hyperplasia involves an increase in the _number_ of cells.[[8\|8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia#cite_note-8)
