Kinjal Raate I also call her K chan, is an old friend at this point we met around 2012-2013 ish and quickly become very good friends.

A very respected and kind friend. Someone I adore a lot. I had some of the best conversations in my life with her and it's amazing to see how we both grow and still enjoy our sometimes goofy and crazy conversations still.

#### Here are some of the things related to her

You have helped me so much when I was at my bottom, I think that's why I was not as broken as I would've been, if not for you.  
I wondered what makes a person so important, one of the reasons is how they treat you when you're at your worst. I didn't have anyone else to talk to you back then other than you.  
I find it very beautiful that I could get someone so perfect at that perfect time.  
You saved helped me so much.  
And when one does so much for you and they themselves don't realize it, it's only natural to do all that you can for them as well.  
We might continue to have trouble in life ahead, I mean it life so it's expected but if someone so wonderful is around all the time I'm sure even the worst of the problems won't seem so bad after all.

* By 2022, as a person, you'd have grown to be a kind of a person who is a lot more mature and a lot less attached to things, whether it's food or people.

* I think by now you'd have learned to make a vegetarian/vegan cake.


* By now, you might have made it a habit to save regularly, and I'm sure it must be going well.


* I'm sure you have also learned some digital skills like Photoshop and Illustrator, etc., and now you're a master of it!


* Spiritually, you'd be a lot more stable by now, as I'm sure you're trying to find the right balance between being peaceful and how much to engage in this world. Being in this world, but not getting affected much by it, is the key to happiness.


* By now you must've made some plan on how to work on your passion and are working towards it in full force.
