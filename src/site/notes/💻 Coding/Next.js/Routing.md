Next.js has a file-system based routing mechanism.
URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by the files and folders in your codebase.

## Routing Conventions
- All routes must be placed inside the **app** folder.
- Every file that corresponds to a route must be names **page.js** or **page.tsx**.
- Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.
