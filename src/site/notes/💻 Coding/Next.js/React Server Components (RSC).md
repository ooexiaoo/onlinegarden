React Server Component is a new architecture introduced by the React team in version 18 which was quickly embraced by Next.js.
The architecture introduces a new way of creating React components, splitting them into two types:
- Server components
- Client components

## React Server Components Contd.
### Server Components
- In Next.js, all components are Server components by default
- They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database
- However, they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions
### Client Components
- To create a Client component, it's necessary to add **"use client"** at the top of the component file
- Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions
