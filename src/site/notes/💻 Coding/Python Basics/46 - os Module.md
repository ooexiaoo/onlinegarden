The os module in Python is a built-in library that provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It allows you to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as reading and writing files, interacting with the file system, and running system commands.

Here are some common tasks you can perform with the os module:

Reading and writing files The os module provides functions for opening, reading, and writing files. For example, to open a file for reading, you can use the open function:

```python
import os

# Open the file in read-only mode
f = os.open("myfile.txt", os.O_RDONLY)

# Read the contents of the file
contents = os.read(f, 1024)

# Close the file
os.close(f)
```

To open a file for writing, you can use the os.O_WRONLY flag:

```python
import os

# Open the file in write-only mode
f = os.open("myfile.txt", os.O_WRONLY)

# Write to the file
os.write(f, b"Hello, world!")

# Close the file
os.close(f)
```

## Interacting with the file system
The os module also provides functions for interacting with the file system. For example, you can use the os.listdir function to get a list of the files in a directory:
```python
import os

# Get a list of the files in the current directory
files = os.listdir(".")
print(files)  # Output: ['myfile.txt', 'otherfile.txt']
```

You can also use the os.mkdir function to create a new directory:

```python
import os

# Create a new directory
os.mkdir("newdir")
```

## Running system commands
Finally, the os module provides functions for running system commands. For example, you can use the os.system function to run a command and get the output:
```python
import os

# Run the "ls" command and print the output
output = os.system("ls")
print(output)  # Output: ['myfile.txt', 'otherfile.txt']
```

You can also use the os.popen function to run a command and get the output as a file-like object:
```python
import os

# Run the "ls" command and get the output as a file-like object
f = os.popen("ls")

# Read the contents of the output
output = f.read()
print(output)  # Output: ['myfile.txt', 'otherfile.txt']

# Close the file-like object
f.close()
```

In summary, the os module in Python is a built-in library that provides a wide variety of functions for interacting with the operating system. It allows you to perform tasks such as reading and writing files, interacting with the file system, and running system commands.

## Main Example
```python
import os

if(not os.path.exists("data")):
    os.mkdir("data")

for i in range(0, 100):
    os.mkdir(f"data/Day{i+1}")
```

## Oslist
```python
import os 
folders = os.listdir("data")

print(os.getcwd())
os.chdir("/Users")
print(os.getcwd())

for folder in folders:
    print(folder)
    print(os.listdir(f"data/{folder}"))
```

## Rename
```python
import os
 

for i in range(0, 100):
    os.rename(f"data/Tutorial{i+1}", f"data/Tutorial {i+1}")
    
```
