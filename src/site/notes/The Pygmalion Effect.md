1. The Pygmalion effect is a phenomenon in which higher beliefs lead to higher performance.
2. The Pygmalion effect can be best understood by a circle.
	1. Our beliefs about another person influence our actions towards that person.
	2. Now this action has an impact on others beliefs about themselves.
	3. As others believes change, it causes their actions to change.
	4. These actions again reinforce our beliefs about the other person. Which repeats the cycle.
