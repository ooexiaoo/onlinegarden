### Fleeting Notes
1. Wealth has to be created by multiple people at the highest level.
2. If you make money and others make money with you, they constantly want to do business with you, which make everyone more money.
3. Having others with you can make it easier to make more. Can give you complimentary skills.
4. If you see a trend in which just one person makes money while people with him don't, it's a sign that most people won't like to do business with that person in the future.
