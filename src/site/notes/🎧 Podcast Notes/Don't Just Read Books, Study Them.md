Read in a targeted manner around problems that you need to solve.

There's no reason to read a book a week, that's just mental masturbation. It's like watching TED talks or [[🌍 Areas/📧 Personal Notes/30 Days No YouTube Challenge\|YouTube]] all day. At that point, it's just another form of media consumption.

The point of reading something is to learn from it, there's no reason to read a book a week when it doesn't change you in any way, and you're still in the same place where you were 4 years ago.
