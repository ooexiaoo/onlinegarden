MOC is nothing more that Map Of Content. This is used as an index, it can be a page that has all the important links related to a topic. It's used to make it easier to see all the content related to one topic on one page.

Make MOCs with the name "MOC" in it to make it easier to find in the future, you can also use tags if necessary.
