Google does not index a lot of posts these days. They would even go as far as de-indexing articles that we already indexed on the site. This kind of behavior from Google is bad for blogging as a whole.

You're at the mercy of Google's algorithm and whatever they think is fit to be indexed. Like, I have an article on Amul about how the company need to change its approach towards vegan products. This kind of article will not be indexed by Google most likely. I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but it just isn't happening for whatever reason.
