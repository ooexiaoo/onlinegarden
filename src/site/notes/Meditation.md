5 minutes of meditation a day goes a long way. When we think about meditation, we usually think of it as a process that takes a long time and is hard to do. It's OK if you can't keep your attention on one point, or you're bad at it.

Approaching meditation should be just like any other game or habit. Repetition is the key in this one as well. Just getting into the habit of meditating for 5 minutes a day is enough to make a huge difference in the way you feel at the end of the day.

I have been using an app called Tide, This app has nice 5 minute meditation practice that can be done. It also has soothing background sound effects that can be used to for working, etc.
