It's good to try reversing things if you get stuck. Looking at it in a new way can help you find a solution.

A good example of this is -
**EXAMPLE -** How can we get more customers?
**REPHRASED -** What can we do so that people don't buy from us?

A logic or [[Decision Tree\|Decision Tree]] can help you tackle a problem by breaking a possible solution into parts. Then you can use those parts to think back and understand each step that lead you there.

This can not always work, but it's a good idea to keep it in mind.
