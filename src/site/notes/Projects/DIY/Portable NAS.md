![MODULAR NAS FOR 2_5 INCH DRIVES FITS RASPBERRY PI 4 AND NANOPI M4V2.jpeg](/img/user/Resources/%F0%9F%93%81%20Files/%F0%9F%93%B8Images/MODULAR%20NAS%20FOR%202_5%20INCH%20DRIVES%20FITS%20RASPBERRY%20PI%204%20AND%20NANOPI%20M4V2.jpeg)
Here is a blurry image of how it should look like, this one is running on a raspberry pi 4, but if we can get a phone to run on linux it will work too.

P.S using a raspberry pi is just easier to work with, but not as powerful as most phones nowadays, with which can you get a good screen as well
