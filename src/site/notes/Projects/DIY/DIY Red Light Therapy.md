To build this I wanted to get the perfect LED's that were in 650nm to 700+nm range, but they are either too expensive to buy or simply not available close enough.
So with a bit of research I found that anything with 620nm - 625nm will also work fine, may not be as effective, but effective enough overall.
So I found this COB LED with driver and everything on [makerbazzar.in](https://makerbazar.in/products/9-watt-ac-dob-led-pcb-for-led-bulbs-red?variant=43967470469360) for like 65rs for a pack of 5. These are 9w each with 20 LEDs, running at 220v.
