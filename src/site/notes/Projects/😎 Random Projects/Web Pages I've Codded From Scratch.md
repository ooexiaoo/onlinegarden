You can find all of these at https://varunsportfolio.pages.dev/

## Matrix
https://ooexiaoo.github.io/Matrix/
Is a cyperpunk style webpage and I added some images and created a projects section as well for this.

## Waifu-Walls
https://ooexiaoo.github.io/Waifu-Walls/
Attempted to create a neomorphic and glassmorphic design, didn't turn out to be too good, but is a good experience to make this design. The webpage doesn't do anything, it's more of a design practice.

## Personal-site-trial
https://ooexiaoo.github.io/personal-site-trial/
I really wanted to try neomorphism design, so spent a few days writing some code for this one. This can be improved further, but there's no reason to, as it was made just to get a hang of the design.

## Topclassicanime
https://ooexiaoo.github.io/topclassicanime/
Glassmorphism anyone?! This is just a simple design for trying glassmorphism. This was fun to make. The site is responsive and just made for practicing design

## Codename
https://ooexiaoo.github.io/codename/
Similar to martix, but more like a personal links page. Very simple single page design.

## Kinjals-landing-page
https://ooexiaoo.github.io/kinjals-landing-page/
Same layout as Codename, but you can see how different it looks when you change the images and background video.

## Ambient Pomodoro
https://ambientpomodoro.pages.dev/Â A working pomodoro timer with background and music changing option. I might work on this more later and add google login so that users can track their progress over time.

## Black ETH
https://blacketh.pages.dev/ A imaginary crypto website. This has video backgrounds, scroll snap, and responsive design with navigation.

## Black & White
https://blacknwhite.pages.dev/ I wanted to make a site that felt minimal and had lots of negative areas that I could play with. This is the result of an imaginary portfolio like web page which uses the absence of objects to have an effect.

## Allen Alex Mini Portfolio
https://alexallenport.pages.dev/ A very small portfolio page with links. This can be made into a proper website if needed, The page is not mobile responsive because there was no need for me to make it so.

## Lily's Cosplay
https://lilyscosplay.pages.dev/ A simple web page with nice images and contact form from **forms.app**. The page has a slider section which was fun to make. There are also micro gestures on images.

## Shane Watson Portfolio
https://shaneportfolio.pages.dev/ A one-page portfolio page. This one is pretty simple as well. It's kinda boring, though.
