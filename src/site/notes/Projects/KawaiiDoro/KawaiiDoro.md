I've made KawaiiDoro after seeing many pomodoro sites on the market. So, it's not like KawaiiDoro does something too different compared to the competition, but I think it would be good to make a site like this that can help people.

Added a bit more functionality. Now users can upload their own background images. There is a **5 MiB** limit on local storage, so any image that is less than **5 MiB** should work almost perfectly. It won't be exact 5 MiB, as some of it is used to store **user's name and custom session times**.
