There are so many things I can say about the relation between dharma and time, but here is the gist of it. If you have expectations from the universe, which is something you shouldn't have, but if you do. Please make sure that you follow your dharma to the best of your knowledge.

And here comes the most important question in your life. What is your dharma? Because once you understand it everything else will become clear, I'm not saying it will get easy. I'm just saying it will become clear.

So here are a few good videos that can help you understand what your dharma is and how it is related to the world we live in. It's a 2 way street, you experience the world and the world provides you with knowledge and more experiences. You take that knowledge and experience, and you follow them to understand what your dharma is.

Dharma is also related to karma, once you understand the link between the two you can then see why following your dharma is important in your life, why it will be helpful to you and the world.
