While Linux is a powerful and versatile operating system with many advantages, there are several reasons why the majority of people may never adopt it as their primary desktop operating system. Some of these reasons include:

1. **Lack of Familiarity:** Many people are already familiar with operating systems like Windows or macOS, which they have been using for years. Switching to Linux often requires learning a new set of commands, interfaces, and software, which can be daunting for many users.

2. **Compatibility Issues:** Some software applications and hardware drivers are designed specifically for Windows or macOS and may not work well or at all on Linux. This can be a significant barrier for users who rely on specific applications or peripherals.

3. **Limited Commercial Software Support:** While Linux has a robust ecosystem of open-source software, it can lack commercial software support from popular companies. People who rely on software like Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office, or certain proprietary games may find Linux lacking in these areas.

4. **Perceived Complexity:** Linux distributions vary in terms of user-friendliness, but many users perceive Linux as more complex than Windows or macOS, particularly for tasks like software installation, troubleshooting, or system maintenance.

5. **Lack of Awareness:** Many people simply may not be aware of Linux as an alternative to Windows or macOS. Operating systems like Windows are heavily marketed and come pre-installed on many computers, making them the default choice for most users.

6. **Resistance to Change:** People are often resistant to change, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as their operating system. Switching to Linux requires effort, and many users may not see a compelling reason to make the switch.

7. **Software Ecosystem:** The software ecosystem on Linux is different from that of Windows or macOS. While there are alternatives for many tasks, they may not be as polished or feature-rich as their proprietary counterparts.

8. **Hardware Limitations:** Some older or specialized hardware may not be well-supported on Linux due to the lack of drivers, which can be a deal-breaker for users with specific hardware requirements.

9. **Lack of Technical Support:** For users who are not tech-savvy, the availability of technical support and customer service can be a crucial factor. Commercial operating systems like Windows and macOS often provide more accessible support options.

10. **Market Dominance:** Windows has long dominated the desktop operating system market, leading to a network effect where more users and businesses choose it because of its widespread use. This dominance can be self-reinforcing.

Despite these challenges, Linux continues to grow its user base, especially in server environments and among tech-savvy users who appreciate its customization, security, and open-source nature. However, for the majority of everyday computer users, the familiarity and convenience of Windows or macOS often outweigh the benefits that Linux offers.

An average person does not care if their OS is open source or not, they don't care if their privacy is at stake, they are simple unaware about these things.
