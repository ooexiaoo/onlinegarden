**Your Time** is a work in progress site. I'm still thinking about what else I can add in here. It's just a fun site to see how much you've lived your life, considering you were to live till 100 years.

There's also bars on the top that show how much of your **day, week, month, & year** have passed. This is like a reminder to the user as to what can they do with their time.

I'll add a blog like note below this to explain the life calendar and the bars. I'm also thinking about adding a meter for the percentage of life left. Which should be simple considering it's divided by 100. Add a button to screenshot the page or something for sharing.
