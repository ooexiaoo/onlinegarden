I found this awesome repo on GitHub that have a prebuilt anime site. So I thought I should deploy my own on [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), which was easy enough to do in a few minutes, and then I had a working site - [Animexia](https://animexia.pages.dev/)

The CSS in there is a mess, like I'm talking about having **1,800 lines of CSS** for each page. I really don't want to clean it all up, so I'll just keep it as it is, other than changing a few minor things.
