Addiction to media consumption is prevalent in today's society. To reduce that kind of consumption, one easy exercise we can do is note how we are feeling with each hour of media consumption.

**Example** - Imagine you're watching YouTube, how do you feel after watching YouTube? You can do this after every half an hour. Like the example below.

| Hour | Feelings |
|---|---|
|1st hour| Feeling pretty good |
|2nd hour | This is kinda boring |
| 3rd hour | What the hell am I doing with my life |

When you put conscious effort and think about how you're feeling at the moment, instead of drowning out your feelings. You can see how bad your habits are. This is one of the easiest ways to realize that what you're doing is actually not even feeling good, but still we continue to do the same thing.

This is where [[🌍 Areas/📈 Personal Growth/Activation Energy\|Activation Energy]] comes in. It takes some effort to stop what you're doing and think actively.
