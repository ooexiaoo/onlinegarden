I've made this note in order to understand the different fallacies that we have and how to deal with it. This will be linked to different notes on fallacies and biases as well.
## What Is a Logical Fallacy?

Logical fallacies are flawed, deceptive, or false arguments that can be proven wrong with reasoning. There are two main types of fallacies:

-   AÂ **formal fallacy**Â is an argument with a premise and conclusion that doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
-   AnÂ **informal fallacy**Â is an error in the form, content, or context of the argument.
