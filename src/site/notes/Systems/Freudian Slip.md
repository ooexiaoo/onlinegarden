## Definition From Wiki
- In [psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis "Psychoanalysis"), a **Freudian slip**, also called **parapraxis**, is an error in speech, [memory], or physical action that occurs due to the interference of an [unconscious] subdued wish or [internal] train of thought. Classical examples involve [slips of the tongue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slips_of_the_tongue "Slips of the tongue"), but psychoanalytic theory also embraces misreadings, mishearings, mistypings, temporary forgettings, and the mislaying and losing of objects.

### Fleeting Notes
1. I thought this is very interesting as for me the slip of tongue doesn't happen, but I think the internal train of thoughts does affect the things we say and do even though they might not be as apparent they are there, and you might not even know about it.
2. Need to read more about this.
