1. Recognize the value of your own time. Spend time on things that bring [[Time Management \| Results]].
2. Example - Spending 100s of hours designing a website for a business when the end goal is to get more customers. Focusing on getting more customers would be more valuable than optimizing your website endlessly.
3. If the task can be delegated or made to be more passive, do it. Optimize things that take up a lot of time.
4. Streamlining a repetitive task is good for saving time.
5. In the end, you want to focus on things that are more valuable in that time.
