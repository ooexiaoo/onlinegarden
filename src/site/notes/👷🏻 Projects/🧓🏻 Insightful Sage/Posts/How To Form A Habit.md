How do we build these habits, and how do we overcome the difficulty? For this, we can split up the process of building habits into 4 stages.  

1.  Cue
2.  Craving
3.  Response
4.  Reward

## Cue

Cue is when we notice that we need to change something in our life. This can be anything like weight gain, etc.  
  
This cue is responsible for us taking future action, It means we notice something is wrong that we want to change.

  

## Craving

Craving is the desire for change.  
  
Now, it's important to notice that even though you might have a cue, you can still be someone who will not take any action to change yourself.  
  
This happens with many people who see that they need to improve, but never take the action to change their habits at all.  
  
You can have a craving but never crave it enough to actually take an action to achieve it.

## Response

The response is the action we take in order to change our habits.  
  
This is where many people fail. To change our old bad habit is where many have a really hard time.  
  
To replace an old habit with a new one, especially when we have been practicing the old habit for a really long time.  
  
This is where a 2-Minutes rule can come in handy. This is where you gradually change a habit by taking it slow but, doing it consistently.

## Reward

No need to explain it too much, but, this is where you start to see the results of your hard work.  
  
With time, you can get used to these results and be bored with them, and even fall back to your old 'bad' habits but, if you stay consistent you can get used to this activity enough to call it a habit.
