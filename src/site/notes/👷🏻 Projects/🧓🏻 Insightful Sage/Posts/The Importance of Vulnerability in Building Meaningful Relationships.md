Have you ever met someone and just instantly clicked with them? Like you could talk for hours about anything and everything? It's an amazing feeling, right? Building strong relationships with people is so important in life. It can help you in your personal and professional life, and it can also bring a lot of happiness and fulfillment.

But building relationships isn't always easy. Sometimes it can be hard to get people to open up to you, especially if you're just getting to know them. That's why I'm here to give you some tips on how to get people to open up and build strong relationships with them.

First things first, you need to share something real and authentic about yourself. It might be something that makes you feel vulnerable, but that's okay. By sharing something about yourself, you're showing that you trust the other person and giving them permission to open up to you as well.

Next, ask emotional questions. This is a great way to get the other person to share their feelings and thoughts with you. Make sure to actively listen to their responses and show that you understand and care about what they're saying.

It's also important to never judge anything that the other person is sharing with you. Everyone has their own opinions and experiences, and it's not up to you to judge them. Just listen and be supportive.

Lastly, relate to their emotions and share your own experiences. This will help you both feel connected and build a stronger relationship.

Building strong relationships takes time and effort, but it's so worth it. By following these steps, you'll be on your way to building strong relationships with the people in your life.

## Share Something Real and Authentic About Yourself
Sharing something real and authentic about yourself can be a powerful tool in building connections with others. But what does it mean to be real and authentic?

For starters, it means being polarizing. Don't be afraid to express your opinions and beliefs, even if they might not be popular with everyone. In fact, it's better to be polarizing because it allows you to attract the people who truly align with your values and beliefs. You don't have to try to please everyone, and you shouldn't. Just be true to yourself and let others decide if they want to be a part of your life or not.

Another aspect of being real and authentic is being self-aware and open about your flaws. Nobody is perfect, and everyone has their own set of flaws and insecurities. By acknowledging your own weaknesses, you make others feel more secure around you. They can see that you are human, just like them, and that it's okay to be imperfect.

Finally, sharing your struggles and worries with others is a powerful way to connect with them. We all have our own challenges in life, and by sharing yours, you show others that they're not alone. You might be surprised to find that others have gone through similar experiences, and that sharing your struggles can actually be a source of strength and inspiration for them.

Being real and authentic is all about being true to yourself, embracing your flaws, and connecting with others through shared experiences. Don't be afraid to share something polarizing, show your vulnerabilities, and talk about your struggles. It might just be the key to building deep and meaningful connections with the people around you.

## Ask Emotional Questions
Have you ever been in a conversation where the other person seemed uninterested or disconnected? It can feel frustrating and unfulfilling. That's why it's crucial to ask emotional questions when engaging in a conversation.

Asking questions that relate to how the other person feels can be a game-changer. It shows that you care about their emotional state and are interested in their perspective. This can open up the conversation to deeper levels and create a more meaningful connection.

But it's not just about asking the right questions. It's equally important to pay full attention to what they're saying. Put away your distractions and focus on their words. It shows that you value them and what they have to say.

To take it one step further, use statements that show effort to understand their emotions. For example, **"I can imagine that must have been tough for you"** or **"It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated about that situation."** These statements show empathy and make the other person feel heard and understood.

Asking emotional questions and actively listening can help to build stronger relationships and make the other person feel seen and valued. So next time you're in a conversation, try asking about their emotions and really listen to what they have to say. You might be surprised by how much it can improve the quality of your interactions.

## Never Judge Anything That The Other Person Is Sharing With You
When building strong relationships with people, it's crucial to avoid judging them. You never know how vulnerable someone may be feeling when sharing their thoughts or experiences with you. By being open and non-judgmental, you create a safe space for the other person to feel heard and understood.

It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique experiences and perspectives, and just because you may not agree with what they're saying, it doesn't mean that their feelings are invalid. When you listen to someone without judgment, you are showing them that you respect their feelings and experiences.

It's easy to slip into a judgmental mindset without even realizing it. We all have our biases and opinions, and sometimes they can cloud our ability to listen and empathize with others. However, it's essential to put these aside and focus on the other person's perspective.

By practicing non-judgment, you can build deeper connections with people. You'll find that when others feel that they can share their thoughts and feelings without being judged, they'll be more likely to open up to you. It takes courage to be vulnerable, and by creating a non-judgmental space, you can make it easier for others to take that step.

So, the next time someone shares something with you, try to keep an open mind and reserve judgment. Listen to their words, pay attention to their emotions, and show them that you care. Remember, you don't have to agree with everything they're saying, but you can still validate their feelings and experiences.

## Go Deep With Them By Relating To Their Emotions
When you want to build a strong relationship with someone, it's important to go beyond surface-level small talk and connect with them on a deeper emotional level. One way to do that is by relating to their emotions and sharing similar experiences.

When someone shares something emotional with you, try to put yourself in their shoes and imagine how they must feel. Then, share a similar experience you have had that made you feel the same way. This shows them that you are listening and that you understand what they are going through.

For example, if someone tells you that they are struggling with anxiety, you could say something like, **"I know how overwhelming anxiety can be. I used to get panic attacks all the time, and it was really difficult to manage."** This shows the other person that they are not alone and that you have been through a similar experience.

It's important to note that you shouldn't try to one-up the other person or make the conversation about yourself. Instead, use your own experience as a way to relate to them and show them that you understand.

Once you have shared your own experience, you can continue to ask questions and encourage the other person to open up further. Repeat the steps we discussed earlier, such as asking emotional questions and never judging anything they share with you. This will help you build a deeper connection and establish a sense of trust with the other person.
