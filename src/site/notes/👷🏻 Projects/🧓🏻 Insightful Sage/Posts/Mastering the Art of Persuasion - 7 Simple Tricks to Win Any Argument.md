These tricks are easy to learn and can be applied in any situation, whether you're arguing with your boss about a project or with your partner about what to have for dinner.

So, if you want to improve your arguing skills, read on. We guarantee that by the end of this post, you'll be equipped with the tools you need to win any argument. No more frustration, no more feeling like you're not being heard. It's time to become an argument champion!

## Know Your Opponent
When it comes to arguing, knowing your opponent is crucial. You might have all the facts and figures on your side, but if you don't understand where your opponent is coming from, your arguments might fall on deaf ears.

It's important to remember that your opponent's perspective is just as valid as yours. They might have experiences, beliefs, or values that are different from yours, and that's okay. In fact, taking the time to understand their viewpoint can help you structure your argument in a way that resonates with them.

Try to put yourself in their shoes and see the issue from their perspective. Ask yourself questions like, **"Why might they feel this way?"** or **"What experiences might have led them to this opinion?"** This kind of empathy can help you develop a more nuanced understanding of the issue, which can in turn help you craft a more persuasive argument.

Of course, it's not always easy to understand where your opponent is coming from, especially if you fundamentally disagree with their stance. But even in these cases, **taking the time to listen to their perspective can be valuable**. Not only does it help you understand the issue better, but it can also foster a more respectful and productive conversation.

In short, knowing your opponent is key to winning an argument. By understanding their perspective, you can tailor your arguments to resonate with them and ultimately increase your chances of success.

## Dissolve Absolutes
When it comes to arguing, using absolutes can be a dangerous game. Saying things like **"always"** or **"never"** can leave you open to having your argument completely dismantled if your opponent is able to find just one exception to your rule.

Instead of relying on absolutes, focus on presenting strong points backed by evidence. Use phrases like **"in most cases"** or **"typically"** to give yourself some wiggle room. This not only strengthens your argument but also makes it harder for your opponent to poke holes in it.

Remember, it's not about being right all the time, **it's about presenting a well-reasoned argument that is based on evidence and logic**. So, instead of using absolutes, be open to the idea that there may be exceptions to your argument and be ready to adjust your stance accordingly.

In addition, dissolving absolutes also means being open to the possibility that your opponent may have some valid points. It's okay to acknowledge that you may not have all the answers and that your opponent's perspective may have some merit. This can help to build trust and respect between you and your opponent, which can ultimately lead to a more productive and fruitful argument.

So, if you want to excel in arguments, avoid using absolutes and focus on presenting strong, evidence-based arguments that are open to discussion and adjustment.

## Create Relation
When it comes to arguing, it's essential to understand that people are naturally more invested in issues that directly impact their lives. It's easier to empathize with something that affects you personally than something that's merely abstract.

This is where creating a connection with your opponent comes in. **If you can show them how your perspective relates to their life, they'll be more interested and invested in resolving the issue**.

For example, if you're arguing about a proposed change in a workplace policy, try to frame your argument in terms of how it affects your opponent and their work environment. This personal connection can make your argument much more compelling.

However, creating a relation doesn't mean that you should only focus on your opponent's experience. It's still essential to communicate your perspective clearly and effectively. But by showing how your argument relates to your opponent's life, you can make it more engaging and relevant to them.

Remember that creating a relation is not about manipulation or deceit. It's about finding common ground and establishing a connection that can lead to a productive conversation. By approaching the argument with empathy and understanding, you can create a more collaborative environment and increase your chances of success.

## Show Flexibility
When it comes to arguing, it's essential to be flexible with your opinions. You can't expect to convince someone if you're unwilling to see their side of things. Instead, show that you're open to new ideas and willing to consider other perspectives. This can make all the difference in winning an argument.

**One way to show flexibility is by acknowledging your opponent's ideas if they make a good point**. By doing so, you demonstrate that you're not just blindly sticking to your beliefs. You're willing to engage with their argument and consider their point of view. This approach also helps to avoid unnecessary conflicts that can arise when people feel like their opinions are being dismissed.

**Another way to show flexibility is to be open to compromise**. It's unlikely that either you or your opponent will get everything you want. So, be prepared to find common ground and work towards a solution that both parties can live with. This can be a powerful way to resolve conflicts and build stronger relationships with those around you.

Showing flexibility during an argument is critical. It demonstrates that you're willing to consider other perspectives, acknowledges good points made by your opponent, and helps to avoid unnecessary conflicts. By being open-minded and flexible, you increase your chances of winning the argument and finding a resolution that works for everyone involved.

## Listen
When we argue, it's easy to get caught up in our own point of view and stop listening to what the other person is saying. But active listening is a crucial skill in any argument. **By listening to your opponent, you can understand their perspective and figure out how to present your argument in a way that they will understand**.

Active listening also shows your opponent that you respect their opinion, which can help to deescalate the situation. When people feel heard and acknowledged, they are more likely to be open to hearing what you have to say.

So, the next time you find yourself in an argument, try to actively listen to your opponent. Don't interrupt them, let them finish their thoughts, and ask questions if you're not sure you understand their perspective. By doing so, you might be surprised at how much easier it is to find common ground and resolve the issue at hand.

## Stay Calm
We've all been there - in the heat of an argument, it's easy to get caught up in emotions and let them take over. However, it's important to remember that getting angry or defensive is rarely productive. In fact, it can often make things worse.

Staying calm during an argument is crucial. **When you remain calm, you are better able to think rationally and objectively**. This can help you to better understand your opponent's perspective and make it easier to find common ground.

So, how can you stay calm during an argument? One approach is to take a deep breath and try to approach the situation with a level head. You might also try to take a step back and assess the situation objectively. Ask yourself why the argument is happening, what you hope to achieve, and whether your approach is helping or hindering progress.

Remember, an argument should be a constructive discussion, not a personal attack. Staying calm and objective can help to keep the conversation focused on the issues at hand, rather than letting emotions take over.

Of course, this is easier said than done. It can be challenging to stay calm, especially if you feel like your opponent is being unreasonable. But by taking a deep breath and approaching the situation objectively, you can increase your chances of finding a resolution that works for everyone involved.

## Use Humor
We've all heard the saying, **"laughter is the best medicine,"** but did you know it's also a useful tool during an argument? Yes, that's right! Humor can be a powerful weapon when used correctly.

During an argument, things can quickly become heated, and tempers can flare. Humor can help to break the tension and diffuse the situation. **A well-timed joke or witty comment can make your opponent see the situation in a different light, and this can help you to win the argument**.

However, using humor during an argument is a delicate art. **You must be careful not to use inappropriate humor, which can make the situation worse**. For example, making fun of your opponent's beliefs or opinions is not appropriate and can escalate the situation.

Instead, use humor to lighten the mood and break the tension. You can use self-deprecating humor to show your opponent that you are not taking yourself too seriously. It can also help to use humor to show your opponent that you understand where they are coming from and are not trying to belittle them.

Humor is an essential tool during an argument. It can help to break the tension and lighten the mood, making it easier to find common ground. So, next time you find yourself in an argument, don't be afraid to use humor, just be sure to use it judiciously.
