## Simple Explanation Of Cryptocurrency

Imagine there are two friends Frank and Daniel. One day they decided to go on a trip to Venice. They made a budget list for all their expenses like residents' flights, etc. They thought of making their bookings online from a site that offered discounts to the first 10 visitors on that day, while making their respective flight bookings, Daniel's transaction failed, and he missed the offer going on. On the other hand, Frank paid his share very quickly. And easily, it became one of the three lucky draw winners.

  

Frank used Bitcoin a type of cryptocurrency. cryptocurrency is a virtual or digital currency that works on blockchain technology and is designed to work as a medium of exchange online to buy goods and services and make payments, which was introduced to the world first 2013 by Satoshi Nakamoto.

  

Daniel felt that it sounds similar to other online payment options. Yes, what makes it so different?

  

Frank, explain. cryptocurrency is decentralized and free from any third-party interference, which means it is not issued and controlled by any government or central authority, unlike other payment systems that banks or governments are handling. And that's why a cryptocurrency transaction never fails.

  

There could be many reasons why Daniels's transaction failed, like he may have exceeded his transfer limit, or his account must have been hacked. Or there could have been some technical issue with his bank service or maybe due to high transaction fees imposed by the bank.

## Convenience

But on the other hand, cryptocurrency charges almost no or very low transaction costs. There is no limit to making transactions. You have 24/7 access to your money. There is no extra delay for extra charges on making international transactions. And the best part is that anybody can use cryptocurrency without the hassles of paperwork. All you need to do is create an account on any digital wallet of cryptocurrency.

  

This is what makes cryptocurrency different from other online payment options. Daniel was impressed by cryptocurrency, but he wondered how it works without the control of an external authority.

cryptocurrency works on blockchain technology. Blockchain is a set of blocks that record information of transactions like who made the transaction to whom the amount of trade in the form of a digital ledger that is distributed across the entire network, meaning the data is replicated and stored on each node across the entire blockchain network, making it more secure and impossible to change or cheat the system.

Then it is verified and validated by every node to proceed with the process of making the transactions.

Now Daniel was completely aware of the whole technology and concept behind cryptocurrency and was influenced by Frank to adopt cryptocurrency in his daily lifestyle, too.

  

He did that by booking his ticket, but sadly, no discount. Like Daniel cryptocurrency has influenced and impacted an enormous number of people worldwide.
