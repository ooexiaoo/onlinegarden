1.  Like compound interest in the financial market and money, we can also get compound interest/benefits in our relationships.
    
2.  Imagine investing in a good relationship for a long time, this relationship will give you more benefits than if you were to start that relationship and break it in between then start it again and do the same thing.
    
3.  With time relationships have the potential to grow at an exponential rate.
    
4.  It depends on how one manages the relationship. It's understandable that there may be some ups and downs or even some times where it might stall and nothing new might happen but, it's standing through all those things and still making it better that gives it that compounding effect.
    
5.  As someone who doesn't have many relationships, I can see the importance of how relationships can be valuable in life, for work-related things, or even for life in general.
    
6.  Relationships are assets if you can make them work properly. Any person can be useful when you really need them to be.
