Today I'm going to talk about a subject that is really important for me. And that should be for anyone interested in improving better life. The idea of creating a powerful life vision.

  

A life vision is crucial to having the life that you want. It will give you both the energy and the motivation to achieve your dreams goals. And it will also give you a clear path to follow when you feel confused.

  

It's not just by chance that all the Olympic athletes have been using the power of vision to win medals and so goes for the most remarkable people we remember today. And the greatest leaders of the world by example, Gandhi, Napoleon, and Alexander the Great. They all had a powerful vision, and so should you.

## Why You Need A Vision Board

If you want to have success, be a remarkable person or a true leader. You should start with a powerful life vision. And this is something you can build. Right now. You can start building your life vision with the process that I'm going to explain today, and I suggest you take the PDF file that I'm going to give a free PDF, you can download that will break down all the processes for you.

  

I will explain what is a live vision, why you should build a vision, how to build the vision, and what to do after you have built it so you work on it every day. A live vision is a strong and clear image of the future you want to create. And the clearer and the most powerful vision will drive you emotionally. It will bring you the motivation you need to accomplish what you want in your life. And the most powerful vision will be something you will be willing to die for something you care so much about that all the actions that you take in your life will be to fulfill that single vision.Â 

  

I have a pretty good example by myself. I was miserable and I felt stuck in life. But I had a vision and I still do. I created the self-discipline necessary to change my career in a field that I am now passionate about. So let me tell you that I truly believe in the power of a vision and I am not the only one without creating a vision, you will end up living the vision of others being a trivial element in society's cog.

  

You will end up living a lazy life where your deepest dreams never come true. And you will end up on your deathbed full of regrets wondering what your life could happen if only you took the time and effort to live the life you ever want. Okay, okay, that's a bit harsh, I must admit. But this image is only to show you how important it is to create a powerful vision.

  

Before we get into how to actually create a vision. I want to clarify some points. So a life vision is not a goal. A goal is something very specific and precise that you want to accomplish. When you create your goals. You have to think about how to achieve them but a vision is totally different. You want it to be emotionally appealing to you so you don't care about how you will achieve it. You care about how you would feel if you wouldn't be living it right now.

  

So you focus on the feeling rather than the process. Also, your vision will be continuously changing. As you were doing personal development, you will know yourself better and realize that some things you once held importantly are not anymore and vice versa. So when you acknowledge this, it is important to change your vision as well.

  

I recommend, that you review your vision every six months or at least once a year. There is nothing wrong with changing your point of view. Also, don't worry too much about creating the perfect vision the first time you need to act now to create the first vision now so you can perfect it time over time. So let's get into the juicy part of how to create your vision.

  

So our powerful vision starts with asking yourself important questions and answering them with brutal honesty. You need to answer them and personally what is important for you, not for your friends, not for your parents, not for society.

## What Questions You Should Ask?

It may seem easy to answer those questions without thinking about society and your friends and the influence of others. But we'll realize down the road, it takes some time to truly know what you want. And the best way to know is to ask yourself and to do a lot of introspection. Again, I'm giving you a free PDF file that you should use for creating your vision. It is filled with questions and has the whole process broken down for you. You can find the link HERE.

  

For now, I will still tell you parts of the questions when you answer those questions. You don't necessarily need to have a timestamp point. But it might help you to think about five years in the future 10 years in the future or, 20 years in the future.

  

In my opinion, the further ahead in time it is the better. So you should start with questions that are really broad like this.

## Broad Questions

What do I believe is best for the world?

What is meaningful for me?

What is my meaning on this planet?

What changes should I do to better the world?

What life do I want to have lived at 20-30-40 years old or older?

What am I capable of in life when I die?

What do I want people to say and remember about me?

  

So yes, those questions are a bit broad and it can help you to be a little bit more specific and ask you other questions like this.

  

How good would my health be in 20 years? You can think about your diet you can think about your exercise, what your body will look like etc.

  

Another one is what skills and knowledge would I have acquired. So do you want to learn an instrument?

  

Do you want to learn certain skills like social skills or to learn psychology? There are a lot of things we can learn in life.

## Friends & Family

Also, what kind of people would I be surrounded with?

And what will my relationship with them be like?

Do you want to be surrounded by friends?

Do you want to have a deep relationship with your family?

What kind of relationship do you want with them?

How close do you want to be with them?

  

That's a really good starting point.

## Wealth & Time

What will I do with my time?

what will you do with your free time with your work time?

What hobbies will you have?

What social activities will you attend?

Those are all good questions about your time?

What wealth would I have acquired?

what will be your net worth?

How much money will you do?

What will be your salary?

How much will you do every year?

Do you have an apartment or a house? Perhaps both?

Will you have a business?

## Your Personal Development

Let's be really precise on this one. Also, what experiences would I have? Lived?

Would you want to travel the world?

Would you want to win certain prizes like an Oscar or a Nobel Prize? Etc.

What will my personality look like?

Will you be more charming?

Will you be more open-minded?

Will you be more motivated in life?

How will I feel most of the day?

Will you feel content about yourself?

Will you appreciate everything that you have?

Will you be happy?

Will you be sad and nostalgic melancholic?

  

What biggest accomplishment will I have done?

What will I give to the community?

What will be my role in this society?

## Note Down Your Vision

So I hope that you took a pen and a paper and already started answering those questions. Those questions are great, but they only scratched the surface. I have a full list of questions.

  

Now that you have answered all those questions, do you have a better understanding of what the best life would be for you? So you can write down a vision statement, something that is really broad and precise and clear at the same time. It needs to be something that is emotionally charged something that you read in the future and you will be emotionally affected by it. And you will be driven by the simple fact of thinking about it.

## Take Your Time

I would suggest you think up to an hour or even more time if you need to, and write as many words as you'd like. And if you'd like afterward, you can iterate it to a lesser or less word by example.

  

My vision is at least 2000 words. So it's a big life vision, but it's something I can refer to and when I read it, it helps me stay on track with my life.

  

So write down your full vision somewhere you know you will be able to review it regularly. After having built the vision. You need to put all your efforts into achieving your vision. This is the hardest part, to be honest, this will not happen by tomorrow. It will need self-discipline motivation and willpower, and it might take months or years to have the emotional strength necessary to act 100% accordingly to your vision.

  

These matters can be talked about in-depth, but for now, you will need to visualize your vision every single day this step is crucial. You will want your vision to be implemented into your subconscious so that it becomes natural for you that your buddy flows with energy and motivation every single day. And you will need a system to visualize that. You will want to make that a habit.

  

You can keep it in a journal you read every morning, or you can build a vision board that you behold five minutes every day or you can record a personal speech about your vision that you will listen to every morning.

  

There are a lot of ways you can achieve that. But that part is primordial. Make it happen. I guarantee you that by making it a habit. Your energy and self-discipline will increase over time and your life vision will start to become clearer, and things that you thought would be impossible will now seem possible. And that is the power of programming your mind for success.
