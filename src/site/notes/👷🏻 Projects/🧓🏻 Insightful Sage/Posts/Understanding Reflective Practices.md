Reflection is a process of thinking about what you do and why you do it. It's a way of analyzing the things that you do and challenging your existing beliefs or assumptions in order to learn from a situation. Do you ever find yourself replaying the events of the day in your head? 

  

Whether it's going through a conversation that happened, thinking about a sequence of events that led to a certain conclusion or thinking about how you felt or reacted at a point in time. At this level, we are quite used to the idea of reflecting on our own actions. However, there is a difference between reflective thinking and reflective practice.

  

And that reflective practice is a deliberate way of thinking about experiences in order to learn from them. Reflective practice is a way of continuously learning new knowledge, skills, and behaviors. testing them out during our everyday actions, in this way, is closely linked to the concept of learning from experience by thinking about what you did and what happened, and deciding what you would do differently next time.

  

Lots of different people have written about reflective practice over the years, which has led to a variety of different models and theories. You may have come across some of these, one of the first people to write about reflective practice Was John Dewey, who defined the reflective practice as the active persistent, and careful consideration of any belief or supposed a form of knowledge and the light of the grounds that support it.

  

In practice, this means having a questioning approach, considering why things are as they are, and thinking about how they can be different.

  

Some key features of reflection include, that it helps us to be conscious of our potential for bias and discrimination and encourages us to look at issues from different perspectives, which help us to scrutinize our own values and assumptions. It helps us to avoid past mistakes and challenges in order to improve our practice. It maximizes our opportunities for learning and is an active process of learning, which involves more than thinking or thoughtful action. Reflection helps us to prevent our skills from becoming out of date.

  

And it's a cyclical process, where reflection leads to the development of new ideas, which are then used to plan the next stages of learning. You will all have different levels of experience in using reflective practice within your role. Some of you may be learning reflective practice as part of their apprenticeship programs, whilst for others, the term may be relatively new. It doesn't matter what your starting point is. Everyone will have a unique experience of using reflective practice, all of which are important and will form a good basis.
