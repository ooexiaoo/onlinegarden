This is a query that most omnivores ask, usually when they are trying to transition to a more sustainable and healthier way of living. So, what is the difference between a vegan and a vegetarian diet? Are they all the same? Or is there any difference?

To answer it simply, ‘Yes’ There is a big difference between the two.

What is a vegetarian diet?

In a vegetarian diet, one does not eat meat, fish, poultry, shellfish, or any other by-products of animal slaughter.

Any vegetarian diet is full of grains, legumes, beans, vegetables, nuts, seeds, pulses, etc. Some vegetarian diets do include eggs and dairy.

 Vegetarians also have different types

There is a variety of vegetarian diets, some of these are the most widely accepted.

Lacto-Ovo vegetarian - This diet is a vegetarian diet but does include eggs and dairy products.

Lacto vegetarian - This just includes dairy products in the diet.

Ovo Vegetarian - This vegetarian diet avoids all types of animal products except eggs.

A vegan Diet - This diet excludes all types of animal products.

There are some other diets too that are not considered strictly vegetarian.

Pescatarian Diet - This diet excludes all animal products except for fish.

And a Flexitarian diet - Is a part-time vegetarian diet.

Pescatarian and flexitarian diets are not considered vegetarian diets strictly.

## Veganism is more than a diet, it’s a way of life

A Vegan diet is the strictest diet among all the others discussed above. The biggest difference between a vegan and a vegetarian diet is ethics. Where vegetarians are opposed to killing animals but are okay to consume animal products as far as the animals are kept in an adequate place.

Vegans are not only opposed to using any kind of animal product but believe that animals have the right to be free from any humans use. Be it for transportation, entertainment, clothing, or science.

So a vegan is opposed to ideas such as using animals for entertainment like rodeos, circuses, zoos, aquariums, etc. Vegans also don’t use animal products for clothing like wool, leather, or suede.

What kind of benefits do these diets offer?

Both a vegetarian and a vegan diet offer many health benefits, From a lower risk of heart disease to lower cancer rates.

Although a vegan diet offers the greatest of the best health benefits, given that one must be on a healthy vegan diet that should be balanced with things like omega 2 fatty acids and vitamin B12, etc. You can see the benefits of a vegan diet in “is veganism healthy?!”

In conclusion

There is more to these diets than just food, it’s about ethics and animal treatment. Both these diets offer a variety of health benefits like heart health, cancer prevention, even reversing certain types of cancers, etc.

## **Is it possible for everyone?**

Yes, of course, it is possible for everyone to go vegetarian or vegan, you can transition slowly from a flexitarian to Lacto-Ovo to a proper vegetarian or vegan. As with time your taste buds and habits evolve the change will become easier and will feel as natural as it should be. It is just as easy as you want it to be.
