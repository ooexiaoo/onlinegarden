# Why vegan milk is better than Cow's Milk

  

## The problem with dairy

  

The dairy industry is one of the most polluting industries on the planet. Using immense resources to keep producing milk and beef. The waste from just 200 dairy cows produces as much nitrogen as the sewage from a community of up to 10,000 people.

  

A single cow can drink as much as 150 liters of water per day. Just in the U.S, there were approximately 9.4 million dairy cows in 2018. Now if you calculate, to keep these cows hydrated we need approximately 1,410,000,000 liters of water every single day.

  

The dairy industry also abuses animals, from killing newborns to forcefully impregnating cows regularly. When these cows stop producing milk, around the age of 4 years, they are then sent to the slaughterhouse. The exploitation of animals remains one of the biggest factors in the dairy industry.

  

Another problem with dairy milk is that itâ€™s not suitable for everyone. Here are some of the reasons why avoiding it would be the best thing.

  

## Lactose intolerance

  

An estimated 75% of the worldâ€™s population is intolerant to lactose, a sugar found in milk. As we age we stop producing lactase, the enzymes that digest lactose. Many people donâ€™t even realize that they are lactose intolerant and continue to consume milk which causes, stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, gas, nausea, and vomiting. Some people also report symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and eczema.

  

## Potential health risks

  

Some potential health risks also include, milk allergy - Around 2-3% of kids under the age of three are allergic to cowâ€™s milk. These can cause problems like rashes, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe anaphylaxis.

  

Other concerns include the overuse of antibiotics, contaminants, pesticides, and hormones in milk. Regular consumption of milk is also linked with cancer and diabetes.

  

## Why Vegan Milk Is A Better Option

  

Now that we know why regular cowâ€™s milk is a problem, letâ€™s see what are the benefits of vegan plant-based milk.

  

All plant-based milk is relatively better on the environment when compared to animal sources, as they donâ€™t require as much water or product harmful chemicals as byproducts in the production process.

  

Letâ€™s see some of the plant-based sources and why they are so special.

  

# Soy Milk

  

Soy is the classic milk alternative, found almost everywhere, soy remains one of the most popular plant-based options. Soy belongs to the legume-based category. It is one power with cowâ€™s milk for the amount of protein it has which is, 3g per 100ml. Many soy milk manufacturers also fortify the milk with calcium, and other vitamins, such as B2, B12, D, and A, making it nutritionally a good alternative to cowâ€™s milk.

  

# Almond Milk

  

If you love eating your cereals then almond milk is the perfect choice for you, providing a mild and nutty taste which is ideal for cereals. Almond milk has fewer calories compared to soy or cowâ€™s milk, It also has less protein. Although almond milk doesnâ€™t have much fat, it does contain a little bit of unsaturated fat, which makes it better than cowâ€™s milk. Homemade almond milk can be rich in calcium, given that enough almonds are used.

  

# Coconut Milk

  

Coconut milk contains one-third the calories of cowâ€™s milk, with half the fat and significantly less protein and carbohydrates. Making it perfect for someone trying to lose weight. The good thing about coconut milk is around 90% of the calories come from saturated fat, which is good for health.

  

If you love to bake, then this is the perfect one for you. Coconut milk is ideal for cooking and baking, giving a delicious aroma. It can be used to make curries, smoothies, pudding, vegetable soup, and even ice cream. 

  

# Oat Milk

  

Oat milk is one of the most widely used plant-based milk you can get these days with a thin consistency that is similar to low-fat milk, It is high in dietary fiber, phytochemicals, and antioxidants. It is also suitable for cooking and baking.

  

Oat milk contains a similar amount of calories to cowâ€™s milk but double the number of carbohydrates. It is also high in fiber and beta-glucan, which helps with digestion and cholesterol control.

  

# Peanut Milk

  

With a nutty flavor, peanut milk is one of my favorites on this list. Easy to make at home with a ton of health benefits. Peanut milk is rich in potassium and magnesium. It goes well with Biscuits and deserts.

  

Peanut milk is the most calorie-dense plant-based milk on the list, packing a total of 330 calories in just 100 grams.

  

# Cashew Milk

  

Not as famous as others on the list but still one of the better ones out there. Cashew milk has a slightly nutty taste which goes well with cooking and baking. It is a great choice for people with high cholesterol levels who need to keep a track of their fat intake, as cashew milk contains mostly unsaturated fats.

  

# Hazelnut Milk

  

If you love to drink hot chocolate but are looking for a good plant-based alternative then, Hazelnut milk is a good option for traditional hot chocolate. With a delicious nutty flavor, it makes a great choice for baked goods and adding to coffee.

  

# Rice Milk

  

Made with milled white or brown rice and water, Rice milk is the least allergenic non-dairy milk that you can get. It is a safe option for those with allergies or intolerances to dairy, gluten, soy, or nuts.

  

Naturally sweet, rice milk goes well with cereals. It is comparatively high in carbohydrates but low in fat, protein, and other nutrients if not enriched or fortified.

  

# Hemp Milk

  

Made from the seeds of the hemp plant, the same plant thatâ€™s used to make the drug cannabis (marijuana). Hemp seeds only contain trace amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is responsible for the high marijuana provides.

  

Hemp milk is a good source of alpha-linolenic acid which makes it a good source of omega-3 fatty acid. Hemp milk is like many other plant-based milks on the list has a slightly nutty flavor making it good with cereals, baking, and cooking.

  

# Quinoa Milk

  

Quinoa is a superfood, very nutritious, gluten-free, and rich in high-quality protein. Quinoa is slightly more expensive than other non-dairy milk and can be hard to find. It is slightly sweet and nutty and has a distinct quinoa flavor that other milk canâ€™t replicate. Quinoa milk also goes well with cereal and warm porridge. It contains a similar amount of carbohydrates to cowâ€™s milk but has fewer calories.

  

# Macadamia Milk

  

Macadamia milk contains mostly water and about 3% macadamia nuts. Being fairly new to the market, it has a richer, smoother, and creamier flavor than most non-dairy milk. It tastes wonderful on its own but goes well with smoothie and coffee too.

  

Macadamia milk contains half the amount of fat of cowâ€™s milk and one-third of calories. It is a great option for people trying to reduce calorie intake. Macadamia milk is a great source of healthy monosaturated fats, with 3.8 grams per cup.
