The term vegan was once not as famous as today, but is veganism actually growing, or is it just a trend that people are talking about more?

  

Well, the short answer is ‘Yes it is growing at a rapid rate. Just how much is it growing is something we’ll see below.

# According to google trends

  

According to Google in the past few years, there’s been a big jump in the number of searches for the word vegan.

  

This number peaked in 2020 and is still on an upward trajectory.

Another interesting search term that also saw a rise was ‘vegan food near me.’

  

This just shows us that way more people are inclined to eat plant-based food even though they are vegan or not. In we can also see that there is more demand for plant-based foods around the world. Which should help business owners realize that adding plant-based options would only benefit them.

# Vegan Restaurants are on the rise

  

We can see a huge rise in vegan options in restaurants in recent years this is partly because of the market reacting to the demand from consumers.

  

Quorn morningstar farms, Beyond meat, and Impossible foods made it a lot easier for meat-eater to find an alternative option in a fast-food market.

# What to expect?

  

Veganism isn’t going anywhere, it’s just getting stronger with time. Due to the Covid pandemic, many people have started shifting to a plant-based lifestyle to avoid these zoonotic diseases.

  

We’ll see a lot more vegans in the future as the population grows and animal farming becomes more and more unsustainable to us.

  

With the rise of plant-derived meat alternatives, the conversion to a plant-based lifestyle will become a lot easier with time.

  

People who realize how easy and healthy this lifestyle is will be making the change quickly and stick to it and more and more people are realizing this as time goes by.
