A documentary showing western society's brainwashing towards gender and how women are being negatively impacted by it. So much so that they can't even answer a simple question, **"What is a woman?"**

Daily wire also made a funny movie called, [[Media DB/movies/Lady Ballers\|Lady Ballers]] to show how it is affecting women.

What I'd like to say is that this is a woman's fight, of course we as men would support them, but if women don't say anything, there's nothing us men will be able to do regarding this matter. Until women stand up for themselves and fight for it. As you can [read here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgender_topics), some women are against it, while others are supporting this.

In my opinion, this will hurt women's sports and other things where women excel at, at an alarming rate. Just another way women are being exploited.
