Though these fossil fuel-running cars are at risk of disappearing completely, a dedicated group in Japan known as the MFG strives to maintain interest in them through road races streamed online. With 10 billion yen at stake and more than three hundred drivers competing, only the \\\"Godly Fifteen\"—the top 15 racers in the circuit—have a chance at advancing and taking the coveted prize. Fresh off a plane from England, 19-year-old Kanata Rivington is eager to take on the fourth installment of the MFG competition. Trained at an elite driving school in his home country, the half-Japanese driver vies for the competition's top spot in his hand-me-down Toyota 86 GT. Despite the disadvantages that come with a dated car, the newcomer is determined to become one of this year's Godly Fifteen. Kanata adopts his father's last name, taking on the moniker \"Kanata Katagiri.\" Conquering the Japanese racing circuit is only a stepping stone towards his real goal: discovering the whereabouts of his missing father.

Started to read the manga, as the anime [[Media DB/series/MF Ghost (2023)\|MF Ghost (2023)]] just completed, and I didn't want to wait till 2024.

I read this for more than an hour yesterday and today as well. I might just end up completing the whole thing in my free time, it seems like.
