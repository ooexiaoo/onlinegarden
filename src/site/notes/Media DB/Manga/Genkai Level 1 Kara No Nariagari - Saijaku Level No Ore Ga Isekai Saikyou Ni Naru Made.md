Currently reading it, found it on YouTube and thought I can read this in free time. It's not that great of a story but "just interesting enough for you to care about what will happen next".

I've read till **chapter 29.2** which is the latest chapter released as of yet **2023-12-11 | 20:43**. If I remember about this then I'll read more of it for sure.
