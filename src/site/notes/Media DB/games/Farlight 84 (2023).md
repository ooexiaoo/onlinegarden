I love this game, have been playing it for over a year now, almost 2 years.
I uninstalled it today, because I felt I might be too addicted to it, and also I don't enjoy playing it as much anymore. You just need to have squads to win games now, as more people joined they created permanent squads/groups where people just play together, It's harder and harder to rank push if you're a solo player anymore! Which I am...

I might go back to playing it again sometime later, but will keep it at a minimum level.
