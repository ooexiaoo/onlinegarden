I've been watching overlord for years now. I thought I might now get to see another season after season 1 ended, but surprisingly I was wrong and overlords seems to have quite a following.

The fight scenes are not as good as you might think from an anime that has so many powerful characters, but this is being adapted from a game and a novel, so it's to be expected. The real greatness of the show comes from the story line and a rich cast of unique characters. The strategy and the politics this show has.

Not for everyone, but a very unique show that the anime industry needs to have.
