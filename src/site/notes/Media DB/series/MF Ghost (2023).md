Another edition from the best racing anime in the world [[Media DB/series/Initial D First Stage (1998)\|Initial D First Stage (1998)]]. This is the second edition to it.

I'm a bit disappointed with it so far as this is not as technical as Initial D was, I want to see inside the driver's head, what they are thinking. I want you to talk about the car's capabilities and small things that make or break the cars.

Sadly MF Ghost is not doing it that much yet. I hope if we get a second season we get to see that.
