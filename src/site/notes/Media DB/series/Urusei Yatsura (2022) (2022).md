Remake of the classic Urusei Yatsura. I've watched some episodes from the old anime, but didn't finish it. This on the other hand feels modern, but has the same feel that the old anime has. The story is a bit more compressed, as the new anime is just 23 episodes long. So they surely skipped quite a bit of content that the old anime had. It's not a bad thing though, the old anime had a slow pace compared to anything from modern.
