Just started this series, watched the 1st episode, it was 1 hour long, had to split it in 2 parts.

Just watched the last episode and this anime has been amazing.

There were many beautiful moments that I can count. Although it's not as technical as [[Media DB/series/Pantheon (2022‚Äì2023)\|Pantheon (2022‚Äì2023)]] even though the anime revolves around A.I. It was beautifully done.

I think we might see a future where the algorithms get so complex that they start to have emotions. The same are [[Media DB/series/Pantheon (2022‚Äì2023)\|Pantheon (2022‚Äì2023)]] or [[Media DB/manga/Origin\|Origin]] where they develop emotions in one way or another. *(Or maybe I'm wrong, and they will just be better than us from the beginning)*.

Either way, the show is a must-watch if you like some suspense and mystery.
