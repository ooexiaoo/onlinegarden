Watched both the seasons. There are some plot holes in the story, but you have to look past it in order to enjoy the show. I think it was entertaining enough, but a little weird that you can't understand the characters too well.

BTW, I loved the CGI movements of the characters, especially the small movements were very realistic. Like in the clip below, the way Juno scoots to the side in her chair.
