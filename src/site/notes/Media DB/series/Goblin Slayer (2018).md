The first episode is brutal. It felt like I was watching some kind of weird hentai and not anime. But I think I get why it was done.

2 reasons, First, You establish that goblins are the enemy and whatever our boy **"Goblin Slayer"** is doing is necessary and just thing to do. Second, it horrifies the viewers just enough so that they keep watching the series to see what happens, and in doing so the start to like the show.

It was good enough that it was bound to have a season 2.

Frankly, I don't remember when I watched it, was it 2018 when it was released or 2020 when it was COVID and I had plenty of time.
