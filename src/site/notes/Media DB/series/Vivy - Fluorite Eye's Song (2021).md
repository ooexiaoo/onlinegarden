I saw a few good fighting shots from this anime and thought I should watch it. It was a bad idea.

It felt like this is nothing more than a promotion piece for some album. The pacing is the story is not that great. Even though you as a viewer understand the stakes for which our protagonist is fighting for. It just doesn't have that impact at all. They spent way too much time in showing us short stories that don't really help the main story when you look at it in a macro.

I felt like I wasted my time watching this anime.

Lots of potential but wasted it all!
