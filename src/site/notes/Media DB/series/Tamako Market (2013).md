I love this anime. It's very soothing and calming. You can just watch this and forget about your worries.

I didn't expect to watch this anime and frankly didn't have any idea that such an anime exists, but I saw an AMV in which Tamako Market Love Story's shots were used and decided to download the movie, only to find out that there's a whole series I need to watch first in order to understand the movie.

I just completed the series and it has been amazing. Now I can finally watch the movie and enjoy it to the fullest.

One thing that I really loved about the anime was the characters being at peace and finding their "ikigai" of sorts. There's this beauty you can see with every character and their love for what they do. It's something that you wish you can find for yourself as well.
