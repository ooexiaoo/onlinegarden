Watched this in 2022. This anime made me relive the feelings I felt when I first started to go out at night as a teenager on my motorbike. The sense of freedom I felt on my motorcycle as I roamed around while the world slept peacefully.

The story was okay. I wouldn't say it was too good, the relationships between the characters could've been made better. Maybe, if we get a season 2, then they may build on it.
