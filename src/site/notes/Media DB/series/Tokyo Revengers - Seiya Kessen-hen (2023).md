Hours = duration * episodes / 60

Dropped it as fast as I could. I don't mind watching time loop/travel anime but, it should be done well. Anime like Steins gate and re:zero do a good job of this but, Tokyo Revengers misses the mark for me.

And to top it all off I hate the main character, He is just crying all the time, I can't stand him at all. This anime is for edgy teenagers, like that Reddit thread **"I'm 13 and this is deep"**.
