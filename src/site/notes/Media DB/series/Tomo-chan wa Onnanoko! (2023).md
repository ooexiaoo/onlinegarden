Pretty average Rom-com anime. The whole plot is that our male protagonist doesn't see our female protagonist, Tomo as a girl because she is so tomboyish.

See [[Media DB/series/Yamada-kun to Lv999 no Koi wo Suru (2023)\|Yamada-kun to Lv999 no Koi wo Suru (2023)]] for something similar, if you're a girl and who wants to watch a pleasant Rom-Com.

The story revolves around how she tries to overcome that. Even though it may not be true.

It's not a great show, but if there's nothing much to do in free time, you can watch this.
