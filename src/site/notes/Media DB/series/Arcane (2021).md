The best show that I watched last year. Yes! Watched it a year later, I didn't even know there is a show called Arcane.

The story is solid, The direction is amazing, The pacing is beautiful. You won't feel it's rushed or boring at all. Every scene is visually beautiful and conveys the message the scene requires the audience to feel. The dialogues and emotions of characters can be felt.

I'm waiting for season 2, hope it's just as good as the first season as the show ended on a very nice cliff hanger.
