Polygon has that typical 3D style, I don't hate it, but you can tell it's from polygon.
More about the story as I complete the anime.

It was a good anime, very adventurous and the world building was beautifully done. I hope to see a second season of this anime, but it seems unlikely as most people didn't watch this show.
