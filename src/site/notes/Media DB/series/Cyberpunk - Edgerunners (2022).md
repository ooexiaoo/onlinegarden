Beautiful show. Packs a nice punch and give a very good emotional release by the end.
Some might say the show wasn't as good as some people say it is, but you really have to read between the lines in order to understand this one, as you might not see the characters showing all their emotions.

Definitely one of the best shows to come out in 2022.
