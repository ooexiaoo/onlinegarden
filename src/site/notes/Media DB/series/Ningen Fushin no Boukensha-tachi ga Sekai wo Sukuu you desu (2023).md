Lovable characters, good backstories, but nothing to write home about. The stories are mostly copy and paste job from other anime mixed in together, but that doesn't mean that it's not a good show.

I would say that the storytelling feels like it's made for very young kids, like 12-13, but they added adult themes like sex too, so I'm confused.

I'm just watching this because there are some very good characters in here and the ending song is really good. Other than that, the story itself is not entertaining.
