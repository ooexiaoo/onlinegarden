In the beginning, I thought this is just another time looping anime, like Steins gate or Re:zero, but I was thoroughly surprised by how well the story was given its individuality.

The first few episodes are not as good, but they are necessary for setting the scene and the stakes for what is about to come. I loved the whole 4th dimension aspect of it, which was very unique, I don't think I've seen any other show use that trope before, and I'm not talking about 4th dimension as in time travelling. I'm talking about the ability for the characters to be in 2 different time periods but touch each other or share information.

The characters are unique, and you just have to be in the suspension of belief in order to enjoy it to the fullest, If you start thinking too objectively, you might not enjoy it as much.
