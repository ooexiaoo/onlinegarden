A very mellow and peaceful anime. I recently watched [[Media DB/series/Tamako Market (2013)\|Tamako Market (2013)]] and this is not similar to it, but still pretty peaceful anime to watch.

I also think only men will watch this, mostly, there is just something about watching things being built that men like. This is all too common, I still watch random things being built on YouTube and love it. Even though it's in no way related to me.
