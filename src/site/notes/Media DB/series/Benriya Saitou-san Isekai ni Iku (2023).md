__Currently watching__, The first few episodes are felt like they only have, 5 minute stories about each character, and frankly, I was about to give up on watching this show. I felt there is no serious story, and it won't convey any message or even make me feel entertained enough.

But I was wrong, and I'm happy that I was wrong. Those first few episodes were just used to introduce the characters in a very unique way, Even though I didn't like the storytelling of those first few episodes, the build up is worth the wait.

You get to see some good backstories, and you finally understand why the characters are they way they are.

I think this will be a good enough show for a solid 7.5

Update ==2023-05-28 | 22:32== - And it was a way better show than I expected it to be. Although It's not as good as many of the other shows, but it has its own uniqueness to it. I enjoyed watching it and hoping for a season 2, which seems unlikely.
