Pretty good series, revenge stories are pretty good if done right. The world building is accurate enough that you don't think something is amiss.

Lots of full-frontal nudity, which for some reason seems to fit well with the whole theme of old Edo style brutal Japan.

The cast seems to be following so kind of ESG rules, I guess. They seem to be using Asians to Japanese people and so on. That seemed a bit woke, but maybe I'm wrong and an idiot.
