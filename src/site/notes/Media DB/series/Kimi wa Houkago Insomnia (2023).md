Beautiful series, still a few episodes left to watch but damn, this is tastefully done. Re-watchable for sure.

==2023-12-16 ==
Finished watching this today in the morning. I had 2 episodes left, watched 1 yesterday and 1 today.

Overall, this was a pleasant anime to enjoy. Just 2 people with the same problem, connecting over shared experience, or should I say a shared problem and slowly finding comfort with each other. All the while helping each other grow.

I give them an **A** for the beautiful starry night visuals (Similar to [[Media DB/series/Yofukashi no Uta (2022)\|Yofukashi no Uta (2022)]] ) and the simplicity in the story. The simplicity somewhat reminds me a bit about [[Media DB/series/Tamako Market (2013)\|Tamako Market (2013)]], even though the characters and the premise are so different.

Romance anime are great to watch, but they should be done properly. I thoroughly enjoyed this show.
