This anime is pretty bad, like I don't have anything else to watch at the moment so I'm watching it.
But if anyone watches it, be ready for the story to go from 0 to a 100 and back to 0 in no time.

The pacing is bad, the characters have no depth, there is useless nudity and ecchi scene for no reasons. And the story just goes places for no good reason.

Like the story could have been so much better but I don't understand what happened. Maybe the manga is better, I don't know.

Anyway will finish this in a few days I think as I search for something better to watch. Although I'm trying to avoid wasting my time watching anime
