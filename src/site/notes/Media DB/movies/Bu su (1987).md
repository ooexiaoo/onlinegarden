Similar way of storytelling as [[Media DB/movies/April Story (1998)\|April Story (1998)]], but this is more darker in many aspects. You get to see the character grow and open up more as the story progresses.

To me, this feels less like a movie and more like something that would happen in real life. __The realities of normal humans that are all around us, but never captured__.
