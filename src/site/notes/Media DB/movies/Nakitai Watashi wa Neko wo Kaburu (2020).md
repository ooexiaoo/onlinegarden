### Plot
"Miyo Sasaki is an energetic high school girl who comes from a broken family consisting of her unconfident father and an overly invested stepmother, whose attempts at connecting with Miyo come across as bothersome. Seeing Kento Hinode as a refuge from all her personal issues, she cannot help herself from forcing her unorthodox demonstrations of love onto her crush.

While Miyo is unable to get Kento's attention as herself, she manages to succeed by interacting with him in the form of a white cat, affectionately nicknamed \"Tarou" by Kento. But Miyo soon realizes that she cannot help Kento with the various problems she overhears in her cat form and is now caught between two tough choices. Will she continue her relationship with him as a cat, or will she reveal her identity and risk what they have in order to help him as her human self?

### What I Think:
Watched 15 mins of this yesterday and completed this morning. Overall, It feels like a good movie.

They missed the whole *"why in love with you"* part, which made me feel like adding the **why** better would've given the movie more depth.

The second half feels a bit rushed and all over the place. Like anything can suddenly happen, and you'll just have to accept it, kind of thing.

It's a good movie, but a forgettable one. Just missed by a little to create a big impact.
