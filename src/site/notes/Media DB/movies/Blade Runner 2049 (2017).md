Didn't watch the full thing yet, but so far it seems very good and dystopian. - **update,** had to watch it in like 3 parts because of how long it was.

Apparently it's a continuation of the original Blade Runner. You don't need to watch the old one to enjoy this, but there are many overlaps, so it's recommended.

I'll watch the old one as well.
