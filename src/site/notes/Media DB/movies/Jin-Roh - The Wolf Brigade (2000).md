**Dark and gritty**. It's a kind of movie that not everyone would watch and enjoy, but it definitely is a movie that one should watch to appreciate the world that must've gone into creating this beautiful story.

This must've been a passion project because these kinds of movies don't do good numbers. Another example that I can think of is [[Media DB/movies/Gyakusatsu Kikan (2017)\|Genocidal Organ]].
