The story is told in a way that won't make sense if you don't sit and think about it for, like, a solid 15 minutes after you watch it. This is intentionally made this was by [Satoshi Kon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kon) who said he likes to make movies that viewers can only understand *70% to 80%* and the rest is left up to the interpretation of viewers.

I enjoyed this movie, and I agree with Satoshi Kon on this, most movies give you a conclusion and don't leave anything for you to interpret. There is not much to think about after you watch the movie.

This [blog post](https://filmcolossus.com/paprika-explained/) does a good job of explaining the ending if you found it difficult to understand. You may also stumble on some details that you may have missed out on.
