I would say it's your typical Tom Cruise movie, full of action and adventure, Re watchable for sure.

One thing I can't get over is that' they ejected all the other crew members that were asleep, and if we see the size of the ship that was ejected it there's no way that the whole ejected part would not have been sucked in as well.

So there's your plot hole but, otherwise it's a nice movie. Could've done with more action though, but that's just me I like to see more action. But adding more action takes away from creating a good story so, I think it was a balancing act that they did a good job of.

CGI quality could be better in some shots, but I'm saying this because its 2023 and I should keep it in mind that this movie was made in 2013 so, Yes, there'll a difference in quality.
