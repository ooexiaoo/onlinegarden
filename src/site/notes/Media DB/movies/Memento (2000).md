The storytelling was great, It just keeps going backwards, and you have to be perspective enough to keep everything in your mind to understand the small details of the story.

This may have inspired __"Gajni"__ which was inspired by some south Indian movie.

I won't say it's a great movie, something that I'd recommend others to watch, but if you do watch it, you'll enjoy it if you like mystery and thriller movies.
