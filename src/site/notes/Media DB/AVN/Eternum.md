## Plot
You‚Äôre moving with your best friend to the city of Kredon, home to some of the best schools and universities in the country, to continue your studies.

However, in Kredon, there‚Äôs only one thing everyone talks about: **ETERNUM**‚Äîthe virtual, hyperreality MMORPG game released a few years ago that revolutionized the world of technology.

With a neural implant that recreates the five senses, it becomes impossible to distinguish between the game and the real world.  
Thousands of servers form the network of Eternum: *from colorful, magic-filled fantasy worlds to foggy sci-fi cities, no world is beyond reach*.

Nevertheless, looking beyond the surface, there's a darker side to this pretty facade: *black markets, torture, rape, illegal content trafficking, unlawful assemblies, data theft*‚Ä¶ Eternum follows the rules of no man.

For some reason, governments turn a blind eye to this; there‚Äôs no regulation and no control. Some say it‚Äôs because the game is highly addictive, some say it‚Äôs because the market moves millions of dollars daily, some say those in power have been bribed, and others say‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something else going on.

And you? What‚Äôs your role in this story?

Well... That‚Äôs up to you now.

## My Thoughts
==2023-12-19 | 10:59==
This AVN still not completed yet, so my thoughts will change in the future, but here's what I think about it now.

This is the best AVN (*Adult Visual Novel*), I've seen till date. The story is impeccable. I first saw it last year, like in the beginning of 2021, when Caribdis had just released the *v0.2* and *v0.3* was on its way.

There is quite a bit of complexity in it. It's not like most AVN's where the goal is to just have sex. Eternum is focused on the story way more than any other AVN I've seen so far.

The characters have depth to them, they each have their own backstory. All of them feel human, they have their strengths and weaknesses.

It just makes you want to take decisions that will help them. You just want to see them happy, and by doing so you kinda forget about sex altogether.

Even though it's not completed yet, I can say that this is a solid 10/10 story so far. **I've played till v0.5**.

The author lures you into the game by promising you awesome sex scenes *(Like most AVNs)* and then drops an amazing story with solid character on you. So much so that you just don't care about sex scenes that much, but they are always a treat, because you really start to care for the characters.

I would also like to point out that this is built on [[Resources/üåè WIKIs/Ren'Py\|Ren'Py]], and it has quite a few limitations, but Caribdis has done a great job of excelling in this department. You never feel limited by what Ren'Py has to offer when you're read/watching Eternum.

The music is amazing. I found many wonderful artists and songs because of Eternum. Songs that I can enjoy.

Eternum is something that will make you laugh, make you cry, scare the shit out of you, and entertain you to no end. Very few AVNs are worth going through again, but this is definitely one of them.

Should you play it? YES! You should if you love great stories
