Python decorators are a powerful and versatile tool that allow you to modify the behavior of functions and methods. They are a way to extend the functionality of a function or method without modifying its source code.

A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that modifies the behavior of the original function. The new function is often referred to as a "decorated" function. The basic syntax for using a decorator is the following:
```python
@decorator_function
def my_function():
	pass
```

The @decorator_function notation is just a shorthand for the following code:
```python
def my_function():
	pass
my_function = decorator_function(my_function)
```

Decorators are often used to add functionality to functions and methods, such as logging, memoization, and access control.

## Practical use case
One common use of decorators is to add logging to a function. For example, you could use a decorator to log the arguments and return value of a function each time it is called:

```python
import logging

def log_function_call(func):
	def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
		logging.info(f"Calling {func.__name__} with args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}")
		result = func(*args, **kwargs)
		logging.info(f"{func.__name__} returned {result}")
		return result
	return decorated



@log_function_call
def my_function(a, b):
	return a + b
```

In this example, the log_function_call decorator takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that logs the function call before and after the original function is called.

## Conclusion
Decorators are a powerful and flexible feature in Python that can be used to add functionality to functions and methods without modifying their source code. They are a great tool for separating concerns, reducing code duplication, and making your code more readable and maintainable.

In conclusion, python decorators are a way to extend the functionality of functions and methods, by modifying its behavior without modifying the source code. They are used for a variety of purposes, such as logging, memoization, access control, and more. They are a powerful tool that can be used to make your code more readable, maintainable, and extendable.

## Main Example
```python
def greet(fx):
  def mfx(*args, **kwargs):
    print("Good Morning")
    fx(*args, **kwargs)
    print("Thanks for using this function")
  return mfx

@greet
def hello():
  print("Hello world")

@greet
def add(a, b):
  print(a+b)
  
# greet(hello)()
hello()
# greet(add)(1, 2)
add(1, 2)
```
