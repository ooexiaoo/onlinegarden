#### 1st code
```python
Print("Hello World")

# Result - Hello World
```
#### Escape Sequence Character and Comment
- To create a new line we use **backslash n**, you don't need to leave spaces around backslash n as well.
- To add a comment, just use a **"#"**. Or to comment out multiple lines, just use **(''')** triple single quotes or triple double quotes.
```python
print("Hey!\nHow are you doing")

# Hey!
#	  How are you doing

'''
Multi
line
comment
'''

"""
Multi
line
comment
"""
```

#### Double Quote Escape Sequence Character
- So to add double quotes inside double quotes all you need to use is a backslash \
- An escape sequence character is a backslash followed by the character you want to insert.
```python
print("Hello, this is \"Varun\"\nand I'm trying to learn Python")

# Hello, this is "Varun
# and I'm trying to learn Python
```

#### Separator
- Separator is used to separate multiple values with what ever you've added, like we added ~ in the example below.
- Similarly end='end' specify what to print at the end. Default is '\n' (line feed).
- File: An object with a write method. Default is sys.stdout.
- Remember that 2 to 4 are optional, You don't really need to use them, but are there if you need them for some reason.
```python
print("Hey", 6, 7, sep="~")

# Hey~6~7

print("Hey", 6, 7, sep="~", end="009\n")
print("Varun")
# Hey~6~7009
# Varun

print("Hey", 6, 7, sep="~", end="009\n")
print("Varun")
# Hey~6~7009
# Varun
```
