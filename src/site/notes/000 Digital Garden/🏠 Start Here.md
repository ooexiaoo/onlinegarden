## 🫨 Where Are You?
You are at my [[🌍 Areas/📧 Personal Notes/What Is A PKM And Why Should You Care\|Personal Knowledge Management Vault]] a place where I keep my notes and ideas.

🕸️ This is my little corner of the internet, where I publicly share my notes related to what I'm doing, what kind of content I'm consuming, etc to practice [[🌍 Areas/📧 Personal Notes/🎓 Learning in Public\|learning in public]].

👷🏻 Everything here is a work in progress. There are very few notes that I'm happy with, the ones that I can call are complete notes. Everything else is just constantly changing.

📄 You can meet me on my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@naamnahihai) channel, or my main site [Exia's Garden](https://exiasgarden.pages.dev). I still need to make a real site where I'll finally post all my notes, but for now these are the places where you can find me and my ideas at.

## How You Should Navigate This Site? 🌎

You can see all the content of the site in the sidebar. Even though this is not the best way to navigate the site, I'm still building it, so for now this is one of the best ways.

⌨️ You can also search of anything you want with the search bar or by simply using **CTRL + K**.

📈 There is also a graph view on every page that will show you which files are linked to the current page, giving you an idea of what is connected to it.

🖱️ You can also hover the internal links and see what is the file's content is a hover popup, if you don't like to click around much, just like Wikipedia.

👉🏻 Feel free to see my [[000 Digital Garden/⌛ Recently Edited Notes\|⌛ Recently Edited Notes]], [[000 Digital Garden/📝 Recently Added Notes\|📝 Recently Added Notes]] and [[000 Digital Garden/Permanent Notes\|Permanent Notes]]. I will organize things better as time goes on. but you can use these as a start for now.

⚡ Feel free to click on the tags to see similar content.

>[! Skip this Backstory] 😿 My Backstory
> I know it's a mess, and I'm trying to sort it all out as much as I can.
The thing is, when I started writing all this, it was never my intention to publish my writings to the web, as you can imagine.
So the notes are not linked together in a way that would make it easy to find related content.
I'm also publishing directly from my obsidian vault, so there are a few limitations as to how the UI will be rendered.

😵‍💫 There are quite a few notes in the vault - **Live Count: 1428** With over **12,60,000 words**.
So I'll try to keep things simple for now and add more complexity to the blog as I sort through the notes.
