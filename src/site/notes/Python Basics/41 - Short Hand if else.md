There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short. Here's an example:
```python
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
```

You can also have multiple else statements on the same line:

### Example
One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:

```python
a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
```

### Another Example
```python
result = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

This syntax is equivalent to the following if-else statement:
```python
if condition:
	result = value_if_true
else:
	result = value_if_false
```

### Conclusion
The shorthand syntax can be a convenient way to write simple if-else statements, especially when you want to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.  
However, it's not suitable for more complex situations where you need to execute multiple statements or perform more complex logic. In those cases, it's best to use the full if-else syntax.

## Main Example
```python
a = 330000
b = 3303
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

c = 9 if a>b else 0
print(c)
```
