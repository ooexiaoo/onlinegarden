1. Chunking is a process by which we divide large pieces of information into smaller chunks that are easier to retain in short term memory. **One item can stand for multiple other items.**
2. Each chunk is a group of information unit. **Words, numbers, phrases, etc.**
3. Most people can chunk **5-6** units of information, and no more than **8-9** units. So **7** being the most commonly observed number people could handle.
4. So much so that it's often known as **"Miller's Magic Number Seven (plus or minus two)".

## Chunking Memory Techniques
### 1. First Letters ("acronyms")
A popular way of chunking is to take the first letters of a set of words you want to learn.

### 2. Made Up Phrases ("acrostics")
Acrostics is a bit like acronyms, but rather than a single word, you assign each letter a new word to make it more memorable.

So for remembering the great lakes of North America -
-   **H**uron
-   **O**ntario
-   **M**ichigan
-   **E**rie
-   **S**uperior

You can use “**H**overing **O**n **M**y **E**xtreme **S**urfboard”, as an acrostic.

### 3. Lists Of Associated Concepts
You can do that by making [[Associations\|Associations]] that are easier to remember, like **pancakes and burritos,** rather than having to remember 12 different things like, **flour, eggs, milk, syrup, lemon, tortillas, chicken breast, rice, peppers, avocado, lettuce, rice**.

### 4. Learn To Relate Numbers
Maybe you have a long list of dates to remember, you can just use basic maths to keep all of them in mind.

If you want to remember key dates of battles in a notable war, you can group them.

You can also find pattern in number. We are good at finding patterns which can help us remember more.
