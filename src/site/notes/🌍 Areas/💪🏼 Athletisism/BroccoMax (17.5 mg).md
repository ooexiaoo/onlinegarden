I have found this on [Amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in/Sulforaphane-Extract-Powder-100gm-Natural-Organic/dp/B0BKVXN7VB/ref=sr_1_32?crid=343UAX28YH805&keywords=Sulforaphane&qid=1702482498&sprefix=sulforaphane+%2Caps%2C300&sr=8-32) but I'm not sure about how effective this is
### What is it?
BroccoMax (17.5 mg) is nothing more than **Sulforaphane Glucosinolate (SGS)**.

Sulforaphane is **a sulfur-rich compound found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, bok choy, and cabbage**.

In these foods, it's in the inactive form glucoraphanin that belongs to the glucosinolate family of plant compounds.

Sulforaphane is activated when glucoraphanin comes into contact with myrosinase, a family of enzymes that play a role in the defense response of plants.

Myrosinase enzymes are only released and activated when a plant is damaged. Therefore, cruciferous vegetables must be cut, chopped, or chewed to release myrosinase and activate sulforaphane ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21194251)).

[Raw vegetables](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/raw-food-vs-cooked-food) have the highest levels of sulforaphane. One study found that raw broccoli had ten times more sulforaphane than cooked broccoli ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18950181)).

Steaming vegetables for one to three minutes may be the best way to optimize sulforaphane levels when cooking ([3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22471240)).

It’s best to cook the vegetables below 284˚F (140˚C), as exceeding this temperature results in a loss of glucosinolates like glucoraphanin ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722699/)).
