**Calcium-alpha-ketoglutarate** (C5H4CaO5•H2O) is a special form mineral [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium "Calcium") that can be used to restore calcium concentration level in the blood back to normal.

Calcium-alpha-ketoglutarate binds excess [phosphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate "Phosphate") and pass it as a waste, re-establishing normal balance of calcium and phosphate in the body.
#### Health benefits
While phosphate and calcium concentration levels are normally kept in balance in healthy bodies, patients with [Hyperparathyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparathyroidism "Hyperparathyroidism") have been shown to benefit from Calcium-alpha-ketoglutarate by reducing elevated concentration level of phosphate in the blood.

#### Importance to bodybuilders
Calcium-alpha-ketoglutarate can be useful as a supplement for [Bodybuilders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilders "Bodybuilders") who frequently have low calcium concentration level due to their high intake of proteins such as [Micellar casein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micellar_casein "Micellar casein") and [Whey protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey_protein "Whey protein").
