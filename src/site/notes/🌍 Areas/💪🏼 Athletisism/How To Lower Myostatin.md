## What Is Myostatin
- Is a Gene _(Protein)_
- Messes up satellite cell activation
- Messes up protein synthesis
- Messes up insulin sensitivity
- increases protein breakdown _(muscle loss)_
- prevents [[Resources/🌏 WIKIs/Hyperplasia\|Hyperplasia]]
- The 3 gram rule (If your body synthesizes 3 grams of protein you'll gain 1 pound of muscle a month)

## Examples Of Low Myostatin

## High Levels Of Myostatin
- Women _(Women have up to twice as many myostatin receptors as Men)_
- Old People _(Myostatin levels drop with age)_
- South Asian _(South Asians are genetically predisposed to have higher levels of myostatin, which is why they are usually lean)_
- Bed Ridden, Casts, Wheelchairs

## 10 Fastest Ways To Lower Myostatin
### **Follistatin**
- Gene (Protein)
- No.1 inhibitor of myostatin
- Binds to it

### **Full Body Workout**
- Full body training gives a bigger reduction in myostatin compared to a split routine
- Training full body is better than just lower body or worse just the upper body _(full body > lower body > upper body)_

### **Nucleus Overload**
- High frequency training
- Drop in myostatin only lasts for about **8-12 hours** _(This is also the reason why protein synthesis peaks within the **24-hour** period)_
- MGF (IGF-1) 12-24 hours post workout

### **Eccentric**
- Heavy Negatives
- Or you can do high volume concentrics to match heavy negative, _It's one or the other_

### **Anabolic Hormones**
- Any anabolic hormones will lower myostatin
- Testosterone
- IGF-1
- MGF (Mechano Growth Factor)
- Growth hormone

### **Lactic Acid**
- Lactic acid lead to a lower myostatin
- Increases Follistatin

### **High Protein Diet**
- Especially Leucine
- Amino acids

### **Caffeine**
- Improves Follistatin to Myostatin ratio

### **Creatine**
- Lowers myostatin

### **Epicathenin**
- Is shown to lower myostatin
- In green tea
- In dark chocolate
