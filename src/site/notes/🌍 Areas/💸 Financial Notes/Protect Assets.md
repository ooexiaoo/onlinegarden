 *Ex- You've never driven a car before and someone has given you car keys. And you think, "These things go fast!" But, you don't know how to drive a car.
 It'll feel both freeing and terrifying at the same time.*
1. Move from exciting to boring kinds of investments as something that might look exciting to you like, bitcoin can be equally risky. But something boring can be safer but not give high returns. Still, it'll continue to grow with the market.
2. Don't put money in something you don't understand.
3. If invested in good stock, mutual funds, and it returned an average of 10%, still this is way better than investing in anything risky.
