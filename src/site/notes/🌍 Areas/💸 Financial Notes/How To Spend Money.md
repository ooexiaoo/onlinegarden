2. Set a target of how much money you'd spend every year, or month.
3. The easiest method to investing is putting it in mutual/Index [[Resources/🌏 WIKIs/funds\|funds]]. Doing so regularly is the best way to approach investing, see [[Resources/🌏 WIKIs/DCA\|DCA]].
4. Be frugal on in personal life. There's no need to waste money on things that don't give any value. Just because others are doing so, doesn't mean that you have to follow the same thing.
