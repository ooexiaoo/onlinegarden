### Fleeting Notes

1. Most of us work from outcome to identity, but we should work to make our habits an identity of ourselves.
2. When we solve problems for outcomes and results, we only solve them temporarily, but when we make it our identity we work beyond that and solve things on systemic level.
3. When it's part of our identity, work for it all the time. EG - I want to get fit because I want to lose weight is an outcomes based habit, Vs I'm a person who wants to be healthy, so I'll go to the gym and take care of my body is an identity based approach. Once you reach your weight goal in the first one, you'll start doing unhealthy things again but with the second one even when you reach your ideal weight you'll continue to keep the good habits because you identity yourself as a healthy person.
