# [[üåç Areas/üìß Personal Notes/30 Days No YouTube Challenge\|30 Days No YouTube Challenge]]
==2023-12-12 - 20:23==

I left [[üåç Areas/üìß Personal Notes/2022-05-16 Free From Social Media\|social media]] a year ago but, I have still not gotten over my YouTube addiction. It's just that YouTube has taken that space for me now and it's very hard to not use YouTube, as it feels like I'm doing something productive even though all the things I'm learning or watching will never be applied anywhere.

It's just knowledge stored in my head. It's not all that bad, I have a habit of having useless knowledge in my head for a long time. The problem is that by investing this time just watching things I'm not able to apply any of the things.

So I'll never find what I really like or [[Projects/üßìüèª Insightful Sage/Posts/Discovering Your Ikigai - A Guide to Finding Your Purpose and Living a Fulfilled Life\|what I want to do in life]]. I'll never commit even if I find it in a certain way. Of course there will always be doubts in life but getting good at something is important part of a fulfilling life.

So I've decided to quite watching YouTube from **2023-12-12** until 12th of Jan. The rules are simple, don't watch it unless you really need to learn something and need [[Projects/DIY/DIY Curved Treadmill\|reference video]].

I listen to podcasts so, I'll just use Spotify to listen, and also take proper notes of it [[Podcast Notes/Harvard Psychiatrist on How To Get Ahead of 99.9% of People (Starting NOW)\|like I did here]].

I just want to come out of it having a better restrain on my social media behaviors and spending that time doing something better than just binge watching YouTube in the name of **"Learning something, or being productive"**.

[Shwetabh](https://www.youtube.com/@ShwetabhGangwar1) once said that if you're not in the top 5% in the world at what you do, you shouldn't be sitting around and being lazy. Kaam Karo!!!

I'm adding this to the day notes template to remind myself to come here and do daily updates.

### Day 1
- This is day one so nothing much happened, I do feel the urge to watch YouTube and I think twice I instinctively opened Brave browser in my phone to open YouTube on it.
- Other than that my mind is making up some excuses as to why the challenge is not that important and why I should not take it seriously. **"There won't be a big change anyway"**. So just fighting my own brain at this point. Reminds me of long distance running from 2017-2018.
