I miss the old way to searching for things on the internet. Where we could find blogs that were unique and insightful. These days almost ever blog I visit feels the same, bland and just a money making machine, making our overlord google happy with their SEO.

So Here is a list of cool blogs I found that have interesting articles.

- [blogroll](https://blogroll.org)
	- A place for the kind of blogs I'm looking for.
- [om.co](https://om.co)
