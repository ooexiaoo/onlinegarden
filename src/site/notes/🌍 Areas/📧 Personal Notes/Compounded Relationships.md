### Fleeting Notes
1. Like compound interest in financial market and money we can also get compound interest/benefits in our relationships.
2. Imagine investing in a good relationship for a long time, this relationship will give you more benefits than if you were to start that relationship and break it in between then start it again and do the same thing.
3. With time relationships have the potential to grow at an exponential rate.
4. It depends on how one manages the relationship. Its understandable that there may be some ups and downs or even some times where it might stall and nothing new might happen but, its standing through all those things and still making it better that gives it that compounding effect.
5. As someone who doesn't have many relationships, I can see the importance of how relationships can be valuable in life, for work related things or even for life in general.
6. Relationships are assets if you can make them work properly. Any person can be useful when you really need them to be. The usefulness doesn't always necessarily has to do anything with what they provide you with.

Make sure you only invest in the positive ones. After some efforts, if some relationships are showing no signs of improvement, it is important to distance yourselves from those people. Time will heal it, or take care of it.

### LPT: No one should invest everything in a single relationship.
-   Instead you should build a portfolio of relationships, preferably with hedges, so that if one goes down, it will be compensated by other relationships going up.
-   Always do due diligence before investing in a relationship. If they can't produce clear quarterly reports with a plan for growth, they're not worth your time.
-   For maximal relationship capital growth, you should invest in CRO's (Collaterized Relationship Obligations), where you back a structured pool of relationships, so you can benefit from the growth on each and more easier weather the downswing in any particular one.
-   Remember that the friendship market can remain unfriendly longer than you can stay happy. Never bet against the market.
-   And finally, remember that no one, least of all relationship coaches, know if the relationship market is going up, down, sideways or in fucking circles.
