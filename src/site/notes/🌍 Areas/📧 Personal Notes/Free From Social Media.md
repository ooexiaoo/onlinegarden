I uninstalled all social media apps from my cellphone on 8th of May. So far it's been going very good. I don't have any reason to go back now.

I don't have any reason to show myself to the world and what I do. 

 ##### This is how I'm thinking about it -
I'm not bringing anything new to the table and this is not due to imposter syndrome, this is a genuine thought. Posting pictures on sites like Facebook or Instagram isn't going to change my world or theirs.

I can try to make videos to bring some awareness to things, but for that I'll just create a YouTube channel in the future and maybe then I'll have a need to be on social media again, for marketing purposes, but for now I have no reason to be there.

I've also realised that I don't have a reason to show my life to the world. Furthermore, I just want to share my life with people who **'really'** love me. So if they want to see me they can meet me, or they can have a video call if needed. There's no need for me to be available to them on every platform where we can't make a genuine connection with each other.

##### I'm feeling good, and I don't have a reason to go back to it again 👍🏻
