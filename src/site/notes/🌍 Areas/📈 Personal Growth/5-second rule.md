### Fleeting Notes
1. **The 5-second rule is simple. If you have an instinct to act on a goal, you must physically move within 5 seconds or your brain will kill it.**
2. We have an inbuilt psychological system that prevents us from doing hard things and wants to keep us lazy. Our [[🛢️ Resources/🌏 WIKIs/Habits\|brain]] is smart enough to come up with an excuse to not do something within 5 seconds.
3. This can be hard initially, but once you start to form the 5-second habit, it becomes easier with time to do harder things and not be lazy.
