### Fleeting Notes
- Activation energy is the effort you need to put in to start working at something. This can be anything, like starting the workout, getting out of bed, etc.
- For every individual, it can take different amount of activation energy to start with the same work/activity. This is due to your individual **habits, fears, anxieties, etc**.
- One might not hesitate to make a sales calls, while others might feel scared. In doing so, using a lot more activation energy to get started.
- Is activation energy the same as [[🌍 Areas/📈 Personal Growth/Willpower\|Willpower]]?
	- Yes and No, Willpower can be considered an umbrella term while activation energy can be a small part of it.
	- Just like willpower, we can have a limited amount of activation energy at our disposal each day. Unless something really unusual happens that might be out of ordinary.
- How can you improve yourself so that you have to use less activation energy?
	-  Make better [[systems\|systems]], and [[🛢️ Resources/🌏 WIKIs/Habits\|Habits]]. Improving systems would mean planning things out properly, especially if you know you hate doing that particular thing.
	-  Write the things which you want to do with all the details you can.
		-  *Example -* I'll start my **'Pull'** workout at **4pm** in the evening. I'll do **4 sets with 12 reps of pull-ups** and *other exercises* in similar details.
		-  Once you have the exact steps laid out in front of you, you'll need way less activation energy to do it. You can continue to do so until your brain makes it easy enough for you where you almost need no willpower to get started.
