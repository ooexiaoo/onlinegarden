Friends and family are the most important part of my life, like for many others. I cannot imagine my life without these people. Although it's hard to explain what they mean to me or how friends and family can give your life meaning but, Here's what I have. I might not be able to formulate all my thoughts properly, So I might add another post in the future.

![Building Blocks of Personality 2023-12-16 03.25.38.excalidraw.png](/img/user/Excalidraw/Building%20Blocks%20of%20Personality%202023-12-16%2003.25.38.excalidraw.png)

Your friends and family are the building blocks of your personality. Even though, you can't really choose your family, unlike your friends. Their influence is what shapes you. **Each brick that is laid down helps create a foundation on which you stand and build your life**.

## They Accept You As You are
Friends and family love you for who you are. Imagine how many people in your life really get to see the real you? I'm talking about the **annoying, demanding, and an idiot you**.

We all go through many of these phases of a daily basis. Most people in your life would never catch a glimpse of who you really are, and that's ok!

We are complex beings with very complex thought processes. To understand us takes time and effort, and no one would genuinely take that much effort to get to know the real you unless they are very similar to you, or they are your family, and you're stuck together for life.

So these are the only people who know the actual you and love you for who you are. There is a bond that is so deep that it almost works on a subconscious level.

You don't think about behaving some way when you're around them. You just exist the way you are, and it's very beautiful, because You get to show your true self but, you also get to see their true versions of themselves.

**No steps or stipulations, no reasons or boundaries, and no mirrors or mirages...** They love you for what they see in you, and it isn't short of amazing that familial bonds were made without you having to do much. I mean, you have to maintain them but, they were made almost beyond your own control.

## Support
Who doesn't love to be supported when they are going through hard stuff in life?! And this is a hard life, no matter how privileged you might be, your life will knock you down a million times and these will be the times when you'll need the right people.

Luckily for most of us, they are almost always around us. Your family and friends can support you in the toughest of times and never think twice about it. When you care for each other on a human level, you try to do everything in your power to keep them safe and happy.

And support is one of the best things you can ever have.

If you have the right support, If you have your family or your friends pushing you to achieve the things you want to achieve, Be sure that, that support alone can make you change the course of your life. And you don't even need many people to support you.

You just need one to do that, but in a normally you can definitely find more than one. Heck, if you have a family like mine, you'll have everyone pushing you to become a better person and get to your goals.

## Motivate And Inspire To Do Better
This is similar to the previous point, but hear me out. If you have loving family and friends, you're more likely to be motivated to do good in life. The reasons are simple you want them to be happy and if you achieve your dreams, make a good career, earn good enough you can fulfil their wishes. It's a win-win for everyone!

When you love someone, and they support you, you'll have an intrinsic urge to do better, become a better person, etc. Bonds make it easier to push for something in life.

## The Best Moments Of Our Lives Are Together
If you're spending most of your time with these people, it's more than likely that you're going to spend the best moments of your life with them as well.

We all go through a lot in our lives, so spending these amazing moments with your close ones is the best thing one can dream of. Going on holidays, spending silly afternoons together, enjoying festivals, and all that goes on in one's lives. It is all that makes this life a lot better.

Spending time together also creates bonds that hold through the test of time. Remember that we are slightly narcissistic and selfish in nature. We only care about people who are in our circle. So it makes sense to have a wonderful circle to enjoy the best of what life has to offer together.

## Parting Words
Life is hard, we go through a lot from good to bad. It's always a good idea to have some amazing people in this journey of life.

You can find meaning in life without a family, yes it's totally possible, but most of us have amazing families so why not make this journey even better with what we've got?!
