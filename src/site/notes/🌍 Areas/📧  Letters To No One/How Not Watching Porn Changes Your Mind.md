The effects of watching porn is already discussed in one of my previous notes [[🌍 Areas/📧 Personal Notes/Masturbation And Porn\|Masturbation And Porn]]. So in this one we'll just focus on what changes when we don't watch porn.

## It Has No Net Positive
Porn overall has no real purpose in your life. We have gotten used to porn in recent years just because we now have the access to it, with fast internet and way too much porn content that's produced on a daily basis.

But porn doesn't do you any good. It doesn't add anything positive to you. So knowing that, it makes sense to just stop watching porn.

## Makes Us Less Of Who We are
Imagine sitting there at night with your phone or laptop watching porn. When you think about it, there's nothing in there to be proud of. As a man, to me, it feels like it makes me less of a man. Why should I sit there alone jerking off? It warps my sense of sexual urges to a point where it is addictive to see these random people having sex on the screen.

I think on a psychological level, it messes you up slowly. As Jordan Peterson said, porn is a novel experience so, to keep it novel, you need to make it more and more extreme as time passes by. Which is true given the kinds of porn we see online these days. Over the years it has gotten more and more extreme, to a point where it is unrealistic. **It's super satiation!**

This unrealistic sense also plays a part in our lives as we try to repeat what we see on the screens. These unrealistic expectations can lead to people not having sex or being disappointed in themselves as they can't do the things they see in the videos.

I think the effect is the same as social media, I don't remember who said this, but it went like this, Before social media you could only compare your life with the people around you. Now with the advent of social media and internet you just have more reasons to be depressed as now you can not only compare your life with people around you, but also everyone in the world.

## We Are The First Ones
We are the first generation to be experiencing something like this in the history of civilization. Today's Men have access to seeing hundreds of nude women in a day, this was not possible 20–30 years ago. I can sit here and see more nude women have sex in a day than any other man from 20 to 30 years ago could see in their lifetime.

We are the guinea pigs on this modern society. There is no way that having this much access with so little effort will not mess up the brain functionality of our future kind. Although access to porn has shown a reduction in sexual crimes in some places but, it doesn't take into account the that the majority of the people are average people who are using this medium to slowly destroy the way they perceive sex as an activity.

## It Creates A False Sense Of Abundance
When you have access to more content than you know what to do with, it creates a false sense of abundance which stops you from make any real effort.

> Don't substitute the false from the real.
> And don't underestimate the utility of deprivation.
* Jordan Peterson

If you understand how [[Dopamine\|Dopamine]] works, you'd understand that dopamine is a chemical that's released in the **expectation** of a reward, not when you get the reward.  You can say dopamine is a chemical that **makes you take action**. It makes you get up and do something because you're going to get a reward out of it.

Now imagine if you're getting all the rewards without taking any initiative. Without going through the efforts and failing. So, imagine never getting up and going to talk to that person who you might want to have sex with, just because you're used to getting all your dopamine hits from porn. As said above, when one gets super satiated, there is no need to take any effort. This behavior gets wired subconsciously to a point where it becomes the norm.
