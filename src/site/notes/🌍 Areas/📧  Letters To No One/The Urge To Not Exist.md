### Fleeting Notes
Sometimes I feel I should not exist. The burden to exist feel heavy. I'm not suicidal, but I think what I'm looking for is peace, and existing and living a life is too burdensome. I'm not looking to kill myself, but I can see the flaws of life. The Maya envelops me, making me want to want things. Even though I might get the things I desire. There is no guarantee that I would find happiness, even if I do, it is not eternal.

I know I'm stuck in the loops of karm and rebirth, but I can see the glimpse of how living a life is nothing but a mirage, like a longing for something that is not worth the effort in the end. You win and still lose.
