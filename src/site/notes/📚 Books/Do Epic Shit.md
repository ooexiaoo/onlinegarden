# 🎨 Impressions
I thought this book will be written is a similar fashion that most business related books are, but this one mostly has a few words on a topic that explain something about life/business/entrepreneurship.

The book itself states in the introduction that **"this book might turn out to the most useless book you'll ever buy. This book doesn't provide anything that you might already not know"**.

To some extent it is true that this might be useless to some, but at the same time this book has some excellent statements that make you wonder about things. Overall, I'd say it's a good book for a light-hearted read.
