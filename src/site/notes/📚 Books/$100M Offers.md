It allows you to differentiate yourself from the marketplace. In other words, it allows you to sell your product based on VALUE not on PRICE. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=417)

This entire book sits atop the assumption that you have at least a “normal” market, which I define as a market that is growing at the same rate as the marketplace and that has common unmet needs that fall into one of three categories: improved health, increased wealth, or improved relationships. — location: [544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=544)

{ #ref-12427}


---
The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you. This price to value discrepancy is what you need to avoid at all costs. — location: [724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=724)

The gap between what they paid (price) and what they got (value) was massive. As a result, the virtuous cycle continued to spin. We charged the most money. We provided the most value. — location: [829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=829)

Perception is reality. It’s not about how much you increase your prospect’s likelihood of success, or decrease the time delay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is not valuable. Many times, they will have no idea. The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice. — location: [898](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099QVG1H8&location=898)
