### Notes
1. Watched 15 mins of this yesterday and completed this morning.
2. Overall, It feels like a good movie. They missed the whole "why in love with you" part, which made me feel like adding the **why** better would've given the movie more depth.
3. The second half feels a bit rushed and all over the place. Like anything can suddenly happen, and you'll just have to accept it, kind of thing.
4. It's a good movie, but a forgettable one. Just missed by a little to create a big impact.

## ⭐⭐⭐ out of **5**
