We have a limited time in our lives, and we have to make the most of what we have. Even though things may not go as we planned, there will always be trajectories that you'd be able to notice in your life.

I thought it was a good idea to create a simple stacked area graph to see some of these. *It's a work in progress*, so here are some things that we all would **(mostly)** have in common.
### Intelligence
Our intelligence grows as we age, but after a certain point our cognition starts to slow down, and we are not as quick thinker as we used to be.

Even though we may be intelligent enough, our reactions and experience can work against to some degree.

### Finance
Most of us don't start earning anything significant until we are 18 years old. From that point on, our money should gradually keep growing.

This is not the case if you face some setbacks, that can totally happen in life. Like health problems, loss in business, etc.

### Strength
Our strength rises quickly after puberty and stays in a good enough form until we are 40. After which, as our hormonal levels start to dwindle, so does our strength.

At this point, all we can do is keep a healthy lifestyle so that we can slow down the rate of decline as much as possible. I recommend looking into Bryan Johnson & [[🌍 Areas/💪🏼 Athletisism/Bryan Johnson Supplement list\|his supplement list]] which I think can be helpful.

We can say the same about intelligence as well. All we can do is keep working out our minds, even if we are retired or are getting old. Keep learning new things like, programming, new language, etc. to keep our minds working.

I'll add more things here as I think about some more points
