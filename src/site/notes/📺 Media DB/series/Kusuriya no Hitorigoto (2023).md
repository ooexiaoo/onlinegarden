I had time, so I watched, entertaining for sure, got to learn a few things about china, and also about some old school medicines

==2023-12-24==
Finished today. It was a better anime than I expected it to be. There are some really dark elements to the anime. I can't imagine how living in that place in that period would be like.

This anime is for someone who like good female leads and is not looking to watch something that is too heavy plot wise.
