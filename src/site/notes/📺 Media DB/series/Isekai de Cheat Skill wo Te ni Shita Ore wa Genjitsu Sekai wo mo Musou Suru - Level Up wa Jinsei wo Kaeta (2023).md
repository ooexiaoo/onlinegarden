So basically, a fat dude finds a door to Narnia and gets to inherit a super-duper magicians house and all the property etc. All his weapons make our guy one of the most powerful fighters in the world, as well as make him extremely handsome and tall (I have no idea how that works, but no more Mr.Fat or ugly). Did I forget to say rich? Yeah, he is rich as well now!

So as any other cool, handsome, rich guy. He is now destined to get all the bitches in the world. Our guy becomes starts creating his harem without even realizing it. If there is ever a problem in the world, our guy is the solution to it.

In short, this is the perfect fantasy anime for any teenage guy in the world. There you have it!

Without joking anymore, I enjoyed the anime quite a lot *(Look, I was once a teenage guy as well)*, but the anime is funny and stupid. You can chill and watch this one. It's enjoyable if you're not using your head much.
