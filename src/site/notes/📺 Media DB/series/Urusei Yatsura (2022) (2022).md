Remake of the classic Urusei Yatsura. I've watched some episodes from the old anime, but didn't finish it. This on the other hand feels modern, but has the same feel that the old anime has.

The story is a bit more compressed, as the new anime is just 23 episodes long. So they surely skipped quite a bit of content that the old anime had. It's not a bad thing, though, the old anime was slow paced compared to anything from modern times.

If you want to enjoy something that feel retro in 2023, This is the perfect anime for you
