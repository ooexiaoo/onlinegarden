I watched 4 episodes, but I didn't think the story moved much. The plot is a bit muddy, what I mean by that is, you don't feel compelled or sold on the plot.

Give me a good romance plot, if you're making a romance anime and move the story forward.

So, maybe the story gets better by the end but I don't want to spend that much time.

I don't think I'll finish this one, unless I'm so bored there's nothing else to watch or do.
